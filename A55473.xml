            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is the greateſt and the Firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; and the ſecond to it is, <hi>Diliges proximum tuum ſicut teipſum, Matth.</hi> 22. 39. Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. From which precepts we may abſolutely ſay, That Love is the onely end of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that God doth therefore ſave us, that we may be perfected in love. Nevertheleſs give me leave to tell you, that this love muſt be to the utmoſt regulated; that is, performed with all due exactneſs both towards God, our Neighbour, and our ſelves, for fear, leaſt otherwiſe, in ſtead of making us agreeable to God and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantageous to us, it prove much prejudicial to our ſouls, and render us difforme to him.</p>
                        <p>Since then we are bound ſo ſtrictly to uſe and exerciſe Love in a right manner, it behoveth us to hear what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

F. <hi>Bernardin. de Siena,</hi> who in one of his Sermons <hi>De Amore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio &amp; privato,</hi> telleth us, That <hi>there are three ſeveral ſorts of Loves; the firſt whereof is lawful, the ſecond to be rejected, but the third totally to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred, as being cauſe of the general deſtruction and ruin of Mankind.</hi> Wherefore, that every one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the one from the other, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover which are the moſt pernicious, and to be avoided; I will in few words
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37302:13"/>
declare and ſpeak of them one by one.</p>
                        <p>In the firſt place there is a Love which is natural and reaſonable; This is lawful to be obſerved by every one. This love appeareth when a perſon ſeeketh and deſireth only that which is lawful, good, profitable, and meet for him, without prejudice to any other: For ſeeing, according to reaſon, no man ſhould have in hatred his own nature, ſubſtance, or being, it is therefore law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to procure all ſuch things as are good and convenient for him, and to diſpoſe of them to his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the good of his ſoul. We are alſo to love our Neighbour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of Nature obligeth and commandeth us to do unto others that which we would deſire ſhould be done to our ſelves in like caſe: Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we are to be vigilant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well how we do love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to the end we may love him well, and ſo as may be both for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> and for our ſpiritual profit, and that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37302:13"/>
our love to God ſuffer no prejudice by it. Now to declare the love we owe unto God, there are many things requiſite and to be obſerved, ſince we are to love him above all things, <hi>with all our underſtanding,</hi> that is, without any error contrary to what he hath revealed for our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; <hi>with all our will,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any oppoſition or contradiction to what he requireth of us; <hi>with all our mind and memory,</hi> that is, without any oblivion or forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him, or of our duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; laſtly, <hi>with all our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and power;</hi> that is, without all ſloth or negligence in performing his holy Service, Commandements, Divine Counſels and Inſpirations.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond ſort of Love before-mentioned, which is to berejected, may be ſaid to be Venial Sin; to wit, when (as we have ſaid before) the paſſion of Love over-reacheth the Rule of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as alſo when the order to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the exerciſe and performance of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37302:14"/>
Love, is not punctually &amp; exactly kept and fulfilled: As for example, according to reaſon, and the great obligation we have to Almighty God, we are to love him above all things, and we are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to love our ſelves and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours purely for the love of him, and not for any other reſpect. Yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, yea very often, experience ſhews that Self-love and proper will (ſuch is our frailty and weakneſs) do exceed their limits, and become more or leſs extravagant, being carried with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not ſo ſutable to reaſon and our obligation, as it ought to be. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, conſidering Divine Clemency, it may well enough be thought, that ſuch extravagant or inordinate deſires, affections, actions, do not alwayes come to ſuch a height as to be mortal ſin, and conſequently may remain (though not perfectly) with Charity; yet for this reaſon, that is, becauſe they do render our Charity (or Love to God) leſs perfect then it ſhould be all the Ancient Fathers and Doctors
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37302:14"/>
of the Church do unanimouſly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and adviſe, that all ſuch Loves be rejected and totally avoided by all in general; but more eſpecially by thoſe who tend to perfection, and in order thereto have by Vow entred the ſtate of a Religious Life. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe if men will volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily give way and ſuffer themſelves to take pleaſure in ſuch inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, affections, loves, of what kind ſoever they be, they expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their ſouls to danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling moſt deeply and deſperately into ſuch ſpiritual Diſeaſe; ſeeing the ſoul thereby grows every day more and more weak and faint in the love of God, and inordinate Self-love grows ſo ſtrong, that in the end it becomes mortal and hardly capable of Cure.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the third and laſt ſort of Love, which we are to declare and ſpeak of more at large in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe, it is that which Divines call <hi>Mortal Self-love and Mortal Sin;</hi> a thing even noiſome and of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37302:15"/>
offence to God, and more than all other evils whatſoever (beſide ſuch as it ſelf is) hurtful and prejudicial to man. For this Self-love is ſo immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and inordinate, that it cauſeth men ſo to forget themſelves, that they undervalue even Almighty God, and by conſequence their own ſalvation. Of this Self-love Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that Satan hath built his great City of <hi>Babylon, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>De Civit. Dei,</hi> and in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. For as the True and Divine Love, which reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Citizens of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> that is, in the Servants of God, takes its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſpring from the Charity of God, and makes them humble, and to undervalue themſelves for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe of God; ſo in the ſame manner the Self-love of the Citizens of <hi>Babylon</hi> takes its original ſpring from their proper will, and they raiſe themſelves ſo high by reaſon of it, that they come to undervalue and deſpiſe even God himſelf, their own ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and eternal intereſt.</p>

                        <p>The duty of our preſent ſtate is, and the chief employment of our whole life ought to be, conſtantly and fervently to co-operate with Divine Grace, and to grow in Vertues; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring always and in every thing to get the victory over our ſelves: that is, over inordinate Self-love, and Self-intereſts, that would debauch us from our duty, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry us into wrong ways: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe God being a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Eſſence, ſuperlatively excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and infinitely above our and all other created natures, requires as a tribute moſt worthy of him, and of juſtice belonging to him, that we totally abſtract our love from all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects whatſoever, and place it in him; not loving any thing but God, and what he commands and allows us to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37302:71"/>
love for his ſake. This I confeſs is impoſſible for us to do by any meer natural ability or ſtrength, according as the moſt Reverend Father <hi>Nicolaus a Sancta Cruce</hi> (a perſon who has been twice Provincial in the Order of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> and is famous as well for his Learning and Piety, as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual labour and pains-taking in the Miſſion of <hi>England)</hi> confirms in his <hi>Cynoſura</hi> (Chap. the firſt page 5th. up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Miſerere</hi> Pſalm) in theſe words: <hi>When man looks into himſelf, he finds a check, ſeeing he cannot ſo much as diſpoſe himſelf for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs without a ſupernatural aid.</hi> For though it be true, that humane nature by its own ſtrength, knows that God is worthy of all love, yet our knowledge in Morality is much more apt for comprehenſion (that is for underſtanding) than for practice. It is not enough to have wings to flie, if they be ſo hamper'd as they cannot be diſplay'd. So this natural faculty in man of loving God above all things,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37302:71"/>
by means of Original Sin; and a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of other obſtacles, is ſo weakened, that we find the inclination of doing it far leſs vigorous and effectual than the <hi>Dictamens</hi> of our Reaſon to have it done. And no wonder, ſince St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> affirms, That <hi>our Will by Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, is much more damnified and impaired, than our Underſtanding.</hi> Whence Self-love grows powerful in uſe, ſo that if it hath not a counter-prize of ſupernatural ſuccours, we yield and ſuffer our ſelves to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hurried on to the purſuit of fading and ſenſual objects; for which cauſe the miſeries of our humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are very much to be pittied and deplored, being ſo wounded and made impotent unto good, as that of her ſelf alone ſhe is not able to pay the leaſt part of what ſhe owes to the moſt lawful object of all hearts; whoſe juſt homages are not only ſighs, groans, or throws of ſpirit, good wiſhes, good deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but effective, that is, actual and real ſervice
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37302:72"/>
done, actual performance of what he commands, exact obſervance of all his holy Precepts, Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a careful, wary, diligent averſion from whatſoever we know to be offenſive to him, and apt to put a ſeperation between God and our Souls. Such are the exceſs of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures, and the immoderate affectation of worldly greatneſs, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, riches and the like. Our love and duty to God likewiſe requires, that we reſiſt temptations, and in many encounters to ſuffer afflictions, miſeries, and all manner of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to mans life; yea, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to loſe and lay down our lives rather then to fall into any tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or ſin, oppoſite to Divine Love.</p>
                        <p>Now all theſe are difficulties, hard things to be done, and do far exceed humane ſtrength, which deſerves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be called rather <hi>weakneſs</hi> than <hi>ſtrength;</hi> ſo that it behoves us to have recourſe to Divine Aid, and to implore the Majeſty of God for the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37302:72"/>
gift of his ſpecial Grace, which may enable us to perform what is required of us; knowing this, that ſhould we be freed from all ſins and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet could we not attain to ſuch a degree of divine love and perfect holineſs, as to love him as much as he deſerves to be loved; how much more is this impoſſible for us to do in this our preſent condition; in which, beſide our natural and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weakneſs, we are through evil cuſtom, and long practice of actual ſin, become moſt averſe and diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to it; being on the contrary wholly poſſeſs'd, fill'd, and taken up with Self-love, and the fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; to wit, purſuing our private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, concerns, proprieties, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and worldly deſigns. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome means I ſhall not omit to produce in this place for the helping us, with more eaſe to vanquiſh this Vice of Self-love, and to get a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect victory over the ſame, which we are not to deſpair of, being
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37302:73"/>
prompted with divine help and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; but to ſay confidently with S. <hi>Paul</hi> (Phil. 4. 13.) <hi>Omnia poſſum in eo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhall be able to do all things</hi> (requiſite to my Salvation) <hi>through Chriſt who ſtrengthens me.</hi>

Alas, he is one that Nature it ſelf would not allow to have a cleanly and neat coming into the world; but on the contrary, ſent him in all covered with blood, and more reſembling a lump of impure fleſh, than a Creature indued with a reaſonable Soul: Inſomuch that none will readily touch him, or take him up from the ground on which he falls <hi>(in ſimiliter factam decidi ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sap.</hi> 7. 3.) none will che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh him, none imbrace him, but thoſe that undertake the office for hire; or the Mother, who by force of natural inclination cannot but love her own Child.

                           <hi>duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> Add unto this, that ſo long as he lives, he is ſubject unto, and very frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with calamities, afflictions, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and the like: So that recalling to mind what is aboveſaid, and well conſidering the troubles both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind which he endures, with the uncertainty and ſhortneſs of his life, I am confident it will, more or leſs, humble his thoughts; and in conſequence, through the grace of God, abate the vehemency of Self-love, and better diſpoſe him to the loving of God alone, and above all other things. In brief, if you would take a true Model of your ſelf, think upon the dead: Let your mind ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reflect upon ſome Friend, Neighbour, or other Acquaintance deceaſed; think what he is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; nothing but duſt, nothing but earth, aſhes, rottenneſs, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo muſt you be, how rich ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, how powerful ſoever, how ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and high ſoever you be, either
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37302:76"/>
in your own conceits, or in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and dignities of this preſent world. The time is coming, when all theſe things will ſignifie nothing to you, though to your ſelf you ſeem to be in good health, ſtrong, luſty, and in the flower of your Age, and think to live a long time; alas<hi>!</hi> theſe are deceitful thoughts, vain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations; a ſudden Feaver, or ſome other unexpected ſickneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or miſchance, eaſily changes the face of your affairs, and puts an end to your ungrounded hopes; though you look well, and find your ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way well diſpoſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet take my Counſel, do not rely upon a ſtaff ſo apt to break; fix your mind and meditations rather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on death; have a Skeleton always before your eyes, which will teach you more truly what you are, and what you muſt come to, than all the painted images of the worlds good: There you will ſee the Origin of your Nobility, and the end of your Glory.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37302:77"/>
The dead was what you are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and your lot will be what they are now.</p>
                        <p>Verily, if you would but look ſeriouſly upon your ſelf, you would find but little matter or reaſon to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and love your ſelf ſo much. What is Man according to his Body? <hi>Job</hi> will tell you (Chap. 7. v. 5.) <hi>Induta eſt caro mea putredine, &amp; ſordibus pulveris. My fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with rottenneſs and filth of duſt; my skin is dried and ſhrunk up.</hi> What is Man according to his Soul? Alas! if he be deſtitute of Grace and true Charity, he is Gods enemy, he is the heir of Hell, and of eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; he is a friend to all ſorts of vanities, a worker of Iniquity, Gods Diſhonour, apt and ready to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but ſlow to all that is good. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, he is a poor creature beſet on all ſides with evil; blind in Counſel, extravagant in his paſſions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, vain-glorious and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his words, and in his deeds
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37302:77"/>
deficient, and falling ſhort of the good he pretends to; in his appetites diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt, and in all things little, ſave only in his own applauſe and eſteem, wherein he is beyond meaſure great; for all which, upon due conſideration he ought rather to have a great aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and diſlike of himſelf, than to be puffed up and ſwelled with Self-love, ſo much to Gods diſhonour and his own prejudice.</p>

I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them under two general heads: To wit, Thoſe which concerns the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37302:78"/>
perfections and unparalled excellencies of Gods Nature in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thoſe which concern his outward works towards us: that is to ſay, the many and great benefits which we daily receive in this world from his infinite goodneſs and mercy, and which we expect to receive in the world to come.</p>
                        <p>As concerning the firſt ſort, we are to know, that whatſoever is amiable of it ſelf (or beloved) it deſerves to be ſo loved according to reaſon, or for ſome reaſon or motive of love that is ſeen in it. As for example, when we love any reaſonable (or humane) creature, if the love be (as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is) reaſonable, and not meerly paſſionate; we love it upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome particular quality or perfection that we ſee in it; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure or degree of that lovely quality in the object, which we apprehend and are affected with all; is our love more or leſs great towards the ſubject wherein it
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37302:79"/>
is. After this manner is all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vertuous love begotten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> it ariſes always from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſomething in the party loved, that juſtly deſerves love; and where there is no ſuch thing ſeen or lookt at in our loving; there is no reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or honeſt love. Now upon this account, what and how great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have we to love God above all Creatures, ſeeing that in him, not only one (or ſome few) but all the reaſons of Love, all the Perfections, all the good Qualities or Properties, that are fit to deſerve and gain Love, are found! All Goodneſs, all Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, all Wiſdom, all Power, all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, all Majeſty, all Glory. They are in him, and ſuperabundantly flow, iſſue, and proceed from him, as from an eternal fountain of Good. All the little rayes and reſemblances of God, which are ſeen in Creatures, are dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Sun; he imparts them all. He makes Men wiſe, vertuous, good; he furniſhes them with all
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37302:79"/>
due feature of body, and gifts of mind; according as the Apoſtle S. <hi>James</hi> aſſures us, ſaying <hi>(Jac.</hi> 1. v. 17.) <hi>Omne datum optimum, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne donum perfectum de ſur ſum eſt. Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we love any perſon for his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, God is infinitely more wiſe; or for his nobility, power, wealth, God is infinitely more noble, mighty, rich. In fine, whatſoever quality or perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can be obſerv'd in Creatures, as a Motive or reaſon of love, the ſame with infinite advantages is to be found in God: How much more therefore are we to love God than Creatures! God, I ſay, who ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all Creatures, not only in the perfections already mention'd, but in all others whatſoever, without any exception.</p>
                        <p>As for his wiſdom, S. <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us, that the depth of it is <hi>unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and <hi>paſt finding out,</hi> Rom. 11
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37302:80"/>
33. <hi>O altitudo divitiarum Sapientiae &amp; Scientiae Dei,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O the height! O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how in comprehenſible are his judgments, and his ways inveſtigable!</hi> There is none like unto him. <hi>Quis poterit ſcrutari ſapientiam ejus,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> (Chap. 36. v. 23.) <hi>Who can,</hi> or <hi>will ever be able to ſearch, and know his wiſdom?</hi> As for his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Titles of his due honour, he ſurpaſſeth all. <hi>Nabuchodonoſor,</hi> though his Enemy at that time, and a wicked King, yet acknowledged this to the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſaying, (Dan. 2. v. 47.) <hi>Vere Deus vester Deus Deorum eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In very deed your God is the God of all Gods, and the Supream Lord of all Kings.</hi> He is, according to S. <hi>John</hi> (Apoc. 19. v. 16.) <hi>Rex Regum, &amp; Dominus Dominantium; King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> As for his Power, Authority and Might, <hi>he ſhall reign for ever and ever,</hi> Luc. 1. v. 33. <hi>Et</hi>

                        <p>As for his Beauty, his comely and excellent features, fair complexion (take it which way you will, whether of body or mind) they are unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd: So the Eſpouſe profeſſeth, Cant. 1. v. 16. <hi>Ecce tu pulcher es, dilecte mi; Ecce tu pulcher es, &amp; decorus. Behold you are fair my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, behold you are fair and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> And Chap. 5. 10. <hi>Dilectus meus candidus &amp; rubicundus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is white and ruddy, the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt amongſt ten thouſand:</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Royal Prophet, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 44. v. 3. <hi>Specioſus forma prae filiis hominum;</hi> among the Sons of men none ſo goodly, none ſo beautiful as he; being moſt perfectly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37302:81"/>
and excelling in all internal and external endowments. As for his great Goodneſs it likewiſe excels, infinitely beyond all compariſon, the goodneſs of all men, and of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for, according to the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Evangeliſt <hi>(Luc.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 19.) <hi>Nemo bonus, niſi ſolus Deus. None is good, but God alone.</hi> Taſt ye therefore the ſweetneſs of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding goodneſs, and ſay with the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 85. v. 5. <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam tu, Domine, ſuavis &amp; mitis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou, O God, art good, ſweet and gentle, and of much mercy to all thoſe that call upon thee.</hi> God of his own nature is good, and benign, ready to beſtow benefits, meek to remit offences, and merciful to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the puniſhments of thoſe that love him.</p>
                        <p>No doubt therefore can be made, but that as God is our Father, moſt good, moſt noble, moſt wiſe, moſt pleaſant and agreeable, moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and fair, moſt powerful, mighty,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:37302:81"/>
able and ready to help; ſo he is more worthy of our love, than any thing can be imagined in Mankind, or in the whole race and order of Creatures. <hi>Nunquid Deo poteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parari homo (Job</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 2.) is there any thing in man that ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to God? no ſure. Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and Divine Perfections are ſuch, that man cannot reach the leaſt ſhadow of them: His goodneſs and mercy is ſuch, that he readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives all injuries, all offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him by ſinners, upon their true repentance, how greatly ſoever, and how often ſoever he be offended. <hi>Si impius egerit poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> in Gods name. If <hi>the impious will but do penance for his ſins which be hath wrought, and obſerve my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments to do them; living he ſhall live, and ſhall not die.</hi> In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he is, as the Eſpouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> ſpeaks him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Totus deſiderabilis, wholly, and in</hi>

                           <hi>all reſpects to be deſired, and to be loved:</hi> There is nothing in him, but what commands love in all that rightly look upon him. <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Jonathan,</hi> that he was <hi>amabilis ſuper amorem mulierum,</hi> lovely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the amiableneſs of Women: How much more true is this of God, the leaſt of whoſe Beauties duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is able to raviſh all hearts with the purer flames of Divine Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! Who would therefore, having a perfect knowledge of theſe Divine Excellencies, but ſubdue his heart to the love of them? Who would not uſe all means, and all endeavours in his power, to conquer his own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Self-love; and withdrawing his ſenſual affections from all worldly Creatures, to fix a pure, holy, and perfect love on God alone, and on his Neighbour for Gods ſake!</p>

                        <head>Sect. 4. <hi>The third means (and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to overcome Self-love) is by knowledge of the benefits we have received, and are to receive from God.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>As to the third motive, which obligeth and induceth us to love God above our ſelves, and all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is grounded not only upon the benefits he confers upon us every moment, which are infinite, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, according to the Sacred Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. v. 28. <hi>In ipſo vivimus, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vemur, &amp; ſumus (in him we live, move, and have our being;)</hi> but alſo upon thoſe that are ſtill expected from him. Either of theſe benefits are a ſufficient motive to oblige us to love God above all, and our ſelves only for his ſake. If we conſider thoſe of the firſt ſort, what greater reaſon of love can be imagined, than to reflect that of our ſelves alone, without his conſent and permiſſion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37302:83"/>
(yea without his ſpecial favour and aſſiſtance in the beſt things, and thoſe of greateſt concernment to us) we can do nothing; without his leave and concurring help, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to lift up our foot from the ground, or move a hand: By his Creation we had our Being firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, and by his Conſervation and continual Protection it is preſerved to us, with all our Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: In him we live, and without him we cannot live; in him we move, act, and do ſuch things as are agreeable or profitable to us; but without him we neither move, nor ſtir any more than a dead Corps; ſo that it is of his mercy and free good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we do not every moment ſink into our firſt and Primitive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as we ſhould infallibly do, if he were not pleaſed by the hand of his Providence, and good will, continually to hold us up. This thing alone being well conſidered (not to ſpeak or mention as yet our
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37302:83"/>
Redemption or Salvation) will make it more than ſufficiently to appear, that God is more worthy to be loved, than we, or the whole race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, are able to love. For (to ſay the truth) neither the Angels nor the Archangels, neither Cherubins nor Seraphins, nor all the Holy Spirits of the Celeſtial Court of Paradice, are able to do this: their moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unanimous affections in this kind; their greateſt and pureſt ſlames of love, could not reach or come up to the merit or worthineſs that is in God to be beloved. Wherefore in this he condeſcends to our infirmity, and requires us to love him above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objects; not ſo much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be loved, but as we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to love, laying no other obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us.</p>
                        <p>It behoves us therefore in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſeeing God is ſo eaſily ſatisfied, and requires of us no ſervice but what is moſt reaſonable, that we give him our whole love, and our whole hearts,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37302:84"/>
and ſerve, worſhip, and adore him with all our might, and with all the power and vertue, and ſtrength of good will, that poſſibly we can uſe. This we may do if we will, and it is all that he requires of us to do. <hi>Fili, praebi mihi cor tuum,</hi> ſaith the ſpirit of God in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> (Chap. 23. v. 26.) <hi>My Son give me thy heart.</hi> Shall we not give it him when he asks it ſo kindly of us? Ah! if we be <hi>Sons,</hi> if we be Loving, Dutiful, and Obedient Children, and not ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Rebels, we will give it him, we will beſtow it wholly upon him; forſaking not only our ſelves, but all other creatures, to adhere cloſely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: loving him with all our Hearts, with all our Underſtanding, with all our Will; and in a word, with all our Soul, and our Spirit: not ſuffering any thing to reſt or have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in our hearts that is contrary to his love, nor minding ought, but what may further us in his ſervice; never forgetting the merits of his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37302:84"/>
great goodneſs towards us: never tainting nor growing ſlothful in doing of his Commandments. We will love him above all things, as our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator and Maker, as our Saviour and Redeemer, as our Everlaſting Joy and Happineſs. All which when Saint <hi>Anſelm</hi> reflected upon, he could not refrain from ſaying, <hi>O my Soul, when I conſider and ponder well, how much you are indebted to the Eternal God, I bluſh at my former negligence, in not performing my duty and great Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Tell me O Lord which way I am to turn my ſelf, and what I can do that will be acceptable to your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that even this kind of love, to wit, the love of Children to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (and <hi>vice verſa</hi> the love of Parents to Children, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> can be no juſt excuſe why we ſhould not love God as we ought; ſeeing that even this love, when it is oppoſite to the love of God, is forbidden us, and we are commanded to caſt it off; there can be no reaſon to doubt, but that all other loves of leſs nearneſs and concernment, of leſs piety and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, of leſs obligation, in like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, are likewiſe forbidden us, and that we are commanded to with-draw our hearts from them, and to give our ſelves wholly to the love of God
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37302:87"/>
above all things; not to love any creature ſo much as we love God, nor to be hindred by it from doing ſervice.</p>
                        <p>The Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> ſeems to be yet more ſtrict (that we ſay not rigorous) in the matter, not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting to the full the accompliſhment of what the Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> mentions, to wit, that we ſhould not love our Parents more than God, or above and before God; but requiring alſo that we ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hate our Parents (if need requires it) for Gods ſake, and renounce all affection, love and Duty to them, rather than to offend God, or to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the leaſt part of the love and Duty we owe to him; for ſo we read, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Si quis venit ad me, &amp; non odit patrem &amp; matrem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>adhuc autem &amp; animam ſuam, non poteſt meus eſſe diſcipulus.

It may ſeem an hard ſentence, but the meaning is eaſie, This we are to do rather than hate God, we muſt hate our Parents, rather than do any thing which he will judge and eſteem an hating of him; we muſt renounce and caſt off all love and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our Parents, rather than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, or caſt off our love and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God. This expreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Evangeliſt obliges us to leap over all ſtumbling blocks that are laid in our way, to hinder us in our going about Gods ſervice: We muſt renounce and reject whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is moſt dear unto us; yea our own ſelves, and all the deſires, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and inclinations of our Hearts; how ſpecious, how morally good, pious and honeſt ſoever they ſeem to be, if they ſtand in our way, and ſtop us from the ſupream love of God. Fie upon all friendſhips (muſt we ſay) fie upon all affections, that are attended with ſuch miſchiefs, and do lead us into ſuch dangers; and fie
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37302:88"/>
upon all diſtracting and diſquieting deſigns of the world, which bend our imaginations wholly to the things unprofitable and impertinent, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſturbing and ſeparating us from the love of God.</p>
                        <p>When we have done this, and that the love of God begins to be well rooted in our hearts, we are in the next place to do our endeavour, that the ſame may increaſe, and grow in us daily more and more, which is beſt done by the continual practice and exerciſe of vertue, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of good works incident to our ſtate and calling; together with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers, and obſerving ſuch Rules of good life, as by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and the labours of pious men, the Chriſtian World, as to that part, is plentifully ſupplied with. Let us have made never ſo great advancement in the love of God, yet we are ſtill to go on, and not to make a ſtand in our Progreſs; much leſs to think or perſwade our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37302:89"/>
ſelves, that we have already attained ſuch a perfect meaſure of loving God with all our hearts, and all our ſouls, as that we need not to add any more to it by Piety and Holy Living: For ſuch a degree of Divine Love is not to be pretended unto in this life, until we come into the Heavenly Court of Paradiſe. So long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we live in this ſtate of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, we are to go conſtantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the exerciſes of Piety and Vertue: For in this caſe it is rightly ſaid, <hi>Non progredi eſt regredi,</hi> Not to go forward in the ſtudy and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Chriſtian Perfection, is to go backward; and not to advance in the love of God, is to fall back, and come ſhort, more or leſs, in point of duty and love to him: and ſo they would find by experience, in a ſhort time, whoſoever ſhould indulge to ſuch a pernicious fancy, to wit, as to think they had done enough, and that they loved God ſo well, as that they needed not take any care of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:37302:89"/>
loving him better, or with a more intenſe, diligent, exact, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate love: Whereas the only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of loving God, is, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> often and excellently teacheth, to love him without meaſure, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to think that we love him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                        <p>In conſequence to what has been ſaid, it follows, that all our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt be imployed towards this end, <hi>viz.</hi> of growing ſtill more and more in the love of God, and leſs and leſs in the love of this world, of our ſelves, and of all things that hinder, or withdraw us from God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as Father <hi>Creſſy</hi> rightly teacheth, <hi>We muſt be guided by a divine light,</hi> and <hi>aſſiſted by divine grace.</hi> The firſt, for the removing ſuch impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as either corrupt nature, or the Ghoſtly Enemy lays in our way to deceive us, and make us give over the purſuit of vertues: The ſecond, to help us forward in our journey, and to bring us more near unto God,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37302:90"/>
till at length we be joyned to him by an immediate Union; to which we ought to aſpire, as the end of our Creation, and the ultimate perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature. We muſt renounce (as we have ſaid before) and fly from our ſelves, that we may draw nigh unto God; we muſt deſtroy Self-love in our ſouls, that ſo the Divine Love may be raiſed up, and increaſed in us; we muſt give our ſelves to the exerciſe and practice of all vertues, as well thoſe which regard our ſelves and our Neighbour, as thoſe which concern God; always remembring, that thoſe which concern our ſelves and our Neighbour (uſually called Moral Vertues) are then only to be eſteemed worthy of that name, (or to be ſtiled Vertues) when they are exerciſed for the love of God, and do effectually help to the mortification of our natural or corrupt paſſions, affections, luſts. Thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and immediately concern God, are called Theological Vertues; and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37302:90"/>
being theſe three, to wit, Faith, Hope, and Charity, are conveniently put in practice (all of them) in the one exerciſe or duty of Prayer, which includes all duties directly pertaining to God; as namely, of loving him with all our hearts and ſouls, of truſting or putting confidence in him, of believing his holy Word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring his Divine Majeſty, obeying his Commandments, ſubmitting and reſigning our ſelves to his Divine Will and Pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>Follow therefore herein the good counſel of Father <hi>Grenadus,</hi> who bids us, <hi>not to ſuffer our minds to be intangled with over-much love of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral objects</hi> (or viſible and worldly things) whether they be Honours, Lands, Riches, or other goods of this world, Children, Kinsfolks, Parents, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Foraſmuch as this kind of love is a great occaſion of all ſorts of ſins, of cares, vexations, vain phantaſies, paſſions, temptations, and all kind of evil diſturbance, unquiet,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37302:91"/>
and diſorder, that is to be found in the world. This Love, according to S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> is <hi>the poyſe of the Soul,</hi> and which way ſoever this Love draweth, that way the Soul incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: So that if this Love de ſet for Heaven, then the Soul is drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven: but if this Love be ſet upon Earth, then is the Soul alſo bent towards Earthly things. This being ſo, it concerns us to walk wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, never ſuffering our heart to fix upon, or to cleave unto the love of viſible things, but rather to eſteem them as things of ſmall account, as frail and uncertain, and ſuch as paſs away in a moment. Remove there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your hearts from them, and fix them wholly upon that which is their chiefeſt and moſt proper object, <hi>viz.</hi> true felicity.</p>

Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not for our ſakes, being God, to deſcend from his high Throne of Majeſty in Heaven, and to be made Man, taking our humane and vile Nature upon him, yea and to be vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, contemned, and undervalued by men; and that in ſuch a meaſure of inhumanity and malice, as is beyond

all expreſſion: and therefore if we will be his true Diſciples, and live after his example, we muſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to humble our ſelves as he did, nor to be ill treated by men as he was. The Servant muſt not expect to be above his Maſter, nor the Diſciple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his Teacher: If Chriſt were ſo humbled for us, we ought to humble our ſelves for him, and where his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice requires it, not to think much to be undervalued, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, deſpiſed, and perſecuted even to death.

undervaluing and diſpiſing our ſelves, we may be honoured and exalted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according to his promiſe <hi>(Luc.</hi> 18. 14.) <hi>Qui ſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliat, exaltibitur.

                        <p>But alas! How far ſhort are we of Perfection in this kind? How few are there amongſt us that forſake either the world or themſelves as they ought?

Obſerve from hence, that all the things which men deſire, or can wiſh for, if they tend not to the true ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negation, to the true ſubmiſſion and humiliation of our ſelves for the love of God, they are tainted with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, Intereſt and Self-love; and though men ſometimes are apt to think that they have clearly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and freed themſelves from this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, yet it is only in appearance, and they have driven it from them as it were on the one ſide, but it returns ſlily and ſecretly upon them ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and ſticks faſt on their Souls; which appears by this, that men ſeldome or never wiſh for or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any great adverſity, any ſharp afflictions, tribulations or croſſes, nor deſire much that any thing ſhould go contrary to their mind (and yet only theſe and ſuch like things can ſhew how they are humbled, how morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and free of Self-love) The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is no other but that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is imperfect in us: We are yet

faint-hearted, and ready to fail in ſmall matters. Men are not as yet come to a true undervaluing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they love themſelves, eſteem themſelves, and ſtill ſeek themſelves too much almoſt in every thing. Self-love is a ſubtile and deceitful vice; it deceives others, it deceives our ſelves, uſing much diſſimulation with every one. Happy is the man that is free of it, that is dead to himſelf; that is to ſay, who is dead in all his ſenſual paſſions and appetites, and in all inordinate affections towards vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible objects, and dead in his own Self-love; deſiring to be vilified and undervalued of all, according to the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who in his own perſon gave us a marvellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of moſt perfect mortification, when being upon the Croſs he cryed out in theſe words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>Deus meus!

                        <p>God our Saviour and Redeemer, hanging thus on the Croſs, was (for certain) deprived of all ſpiritual and ſenſible conſolation, yet did he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer moſt willingly, and not in the leaſt loſe his courage.

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection does not conſiſt ſo much in the gifts of a ſenſible Love, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Conſolations, but in that which may be more real and eſſential, though leſs ſenſible: to wit, in a well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and well-grounded affection of reſolution of mind for God, and for the performonce of his Holy Will and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37302:95"/>

the Fleſh, we muſt not fulfil<hi>:</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>If you walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, you ſhall die; but if by the Spirit, you mortifie the deeds of the Fleſh, you ſhall live.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us that we mortifie and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the Fleſh by the Spirit, and for as much as the Fleſh rebelleth ſo much and ſo often againſt the Spirit, the Spirit muſt be encouraged by all the good means we can uſe againſt the Fleſh, and the ſenſual motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So that the only way for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to obtain tranquility and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect peace, is to be continually fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this Enemy: We muſt ſeek our Peace in Wars, our Life in Death, that is, in dying to ſin, that we may live to God; and finally, our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt liberty in ſervitude; for if we be the ſervants of God, and of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, we ſhall be free from the ſlavery of ſin and wickedneſs, which is the beſt liberty of all.</p>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37302:98"/>
it ſelf beſt in overcoming himſelf and his paſſions. To ſubdue and make ſubject the ſenſual appetites of the Fleſh to the Spirit, is the work of a great and heroick mind; as on the contrary to follow and obey them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch, ſpeaks a great tepidity, and weakneſs of heart. In this kind of Combate 'tis no diſgrace to flie and run away, but rather 'tis the beſt art of fighting; for by flying and running away, we are ſure to gain the victory; neither does any thing more diſcourage, vex, trouble and mortifie our adverſary, than to know that we dare not encounter, we dare not come up to him. By flying from the World, we avoid the ſnares of the World; by flying from the Fleſh, we eſcape the temptations of the Fleſh; and by flying and running from our ſelves; we make void and of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all private affections, all private and proper intereſts that may be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto us, and all the private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Self-love. So that by flying
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37302:99"/>
we conquer the World, the Fleſh, the Devil; our wicked ſelves alſo and all. We lead captive all evil inclinations whatſoever, and ſo pacifie and quiet our exteriour or outward Man, as that we make the interiour or inward Man to reign and rule in us in much peace; gaining thereby a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and illuſtrious triumph, than if we had vanquiſhed whole armies, and ſubdued the mightieſt Kingdoms of the whole World. <hi>Joſue</hi> by flying and running away from the City of <hi>Hay (Joſ.</hi> 8. 15.) obtain'd a great victory over his enemies, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued that City, which but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had put the whole Army of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to flight. So if you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and ſubdue to Reaſon all your unreaſonable and diſorderly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, the only way is to flie from them, not to attend to them nor hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any thing they ſuggeſt.

I will in ſhort ſpeak a word or two more to that effect, that if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to attain the Perfection of that Grace, to wit, of Divine Love, I may by the mercy of God, be a little helpful to you in order thereto: Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it ſtandeth with great reaſon, that we ſhould love God in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-ſaid; both Juſtice and Natural Reaſon dictating and commanding with all urgency, that we ſhould wholly give and dedicate our ſelves by love unto God; and by lovin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I anſwer no; it is not alwayes ſufficient: in ſome caſes it is, and in ſome it is not. When the love of our Neighbour tends to the honour and glory of God, then it is ſufficient; and then by loving our Neighbours as our ſelves, we do fulfill Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, or the Precept of loving our Neighbour: but when it is on the contrary; that is, when the love
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37302:109"/>
of our Neighbour tends to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, or be ſuch as he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by it, then inſtead of being a fulfilling of Gods Commandement, or a juſt performance of our Duty and Obligation, it is matter of high diſpleaſure againſt God, and we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the guilt of great and grievous offence, in ſo loving our Neighbour. And therefore, as <hi>Luſitanus,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Friers Minors, doth well obſerve and admoniſh us, <hi>Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>in Com. Apoſt. Though the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God doth exact of us to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, yet we ought to conſider how this is to be done; by reaſon that many men love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amiſs, not according to God, but according to the luſts of concupiſcence; giving themſelves up to all ſorts of inordinate love, ſo as to drown and caſt themſelves thereby into eternal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi> For ſuch men to love thoir Neighbour as they love themſelves, were to make ſport for the Devil, and to aggravate their own damnation.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37302:110"/>
As for example, a fawning and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Lover, will not ſtick to ſay to ſome vain woman, that <hi>he loves her as much as he loves his own ſelf;</hi> and with <hi>all his heart:</hi> and though for the moſt part ſuch people mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than they ſay, yet they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unawares a ſad truth. For they love themſelves not well, they love not themſelves ſo as they ought, but with a love, that in fine will carry them headlong to Hell, and plunge them into the deepeſt pit of Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Well therefore may they profeſs to their companions in lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>that they love them as they love themſelves, and their own hearts;</hi> and if their Copeſmates conſent with them, and love them as well, they will both have the Sentence of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Wrath pronounced againſt them, <hi>Go ye wicked into everlaſting fire,</hi> Matth. 25. 41.

                        <p>Now to know the True Lovers from falſe, and alſo how to love our Neighbour rightly, the great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> will teach us, <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le veraciter amat proximum, qui eum diligit in Deo. (Greg. Homil.</hi> 27. <hi>in Evang.

They love him only with a natural love. Thus Parents love their Children, and Children their

Parents, Kindred love their Kindred or Relations, Friends love their Friends, and others love their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, Familiars, Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Love, although ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, it be not diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but lawful and honeſt in the eye of the world, yet it is not that true love whereof we now ſpeak; being not grounded upon God, nor exerciſed principally for his ſake, but upon natural grounds, to wit, upon the particular properties, qualities, and perfections (Natural or Moral) that are found in things; and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed meerly upon our own account, for the good, the pleaſure, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, content and profit, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the perſons we love: by all which kind of love, though we do not tranſgreſs any Divine Precept, nor ſin, properly ſpeaking, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we deſerve any reward for it at Gods hand; becauſe (as the ſame holy Doctor ſays) ſuch Lovers, <hi>amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem ſuum non ſpiritualiter, ſed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter</hi>
                           <pb n="203" facs="tcp:37302:111"/>
                           <hi>impendunt,</hi> exerciſe love, not after a ſpiritual, but a natural, and (as it were) carnal manner. Such love may be commendable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; but meritorious it is not. We muſt therefore learn to be True Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by exactly obſerving and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Commandment of Chriſt; who when he firſt gave this Precept to the Apoſtles, propounded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an example thereof to them: <hi>Hoc eſt praeceptum meum, ut diliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis invicem, ſicut dilexi vos,</hi> Joan. 15. v. 12. <hi>This is my Commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</hi> Our Saviour loves us in God, and for our Eternal Good; ſo in the ſame manner are we to love our Neighbour.</p>
                        <p>This great Doctor moreover ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and mentions it as a matter, whereat ſome wondered, others di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed and enquired ſolicitouſly, how it could ſtand, that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us ſo ſtrictly to love our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſince elſewhere, and at other
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:37302:112"/>
times he requires us not only to have them in averſion, but alſo to hate them; and not only our common Neighbours, and ſuch as may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as well Strangers as Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but even thoſe of the neareſt and deareſt relation to us; that is to ſay, even our Parents, Brothers, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Wives and Children: As for example, by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in very earneſt and expreſſive terms, that Men love their Wives; ſaying <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 26. <hi>Viri diligite uxores veſtras,</hi> &amp;c. Husbands love your Wives, as Chriſt loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it; and yet, by the Evangeliſt he ſayes, <hi>Qui <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xorem non odit, non poteſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us eſſe Diſcipulus;</hi> Luc. 14. v. 26. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs Men hate their Wives, they cannot be his Diſciples.</hi> Is Chriſt contrary to himſelf? Does he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that by one Apoſtle, which he forbids by another? Nothing leſs. For we ought to reflect and conſider, that the ſubſtance and effect of both
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37302:112"/>
Precepts, is by diſcretion and a right underſtanding eaſily kept and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and that in different reſpects, and for divers reaſons, we may both love them, and hate them. We may love them for Gods ſake, as being our Parents, Friends, Wives, and Neighbours, whom God commands us to love. We may hate them, when they prove obſtacles and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances to our chiefeſt good, when they become ſtumbling blocks unto us in the way of our Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when the loving of them will not ſtand with our Love and Duty to God, we may hate them. For ſo it is written in the Expoſition of this great Doctor above-mentioned. <hi>There is no Creature</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo dear unto us, which we muſt not hate and forſake, if it hinder us from Chriſt, or from his Church, or from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe no earthly Thing, no Duty to Parents, no Love to Wife or Children, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, or to a mans own body and life,

                        <p>Having thus declared, That we are to love God and our Neighbour, we are to make ſome enquiry about lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Enemies, a thing very much againſt the natural bent of our minds. We do not at all times find it eaſie for us to love our Neighbors, who either love us, or at leaſt do not hate us, or wiſh our harm: Much more difficult then it will be for us to love our enemies; of whom we have apprehenſion that they do both; that is, both hate us, and wiſh and practice harm to us. But how difficult ſoever it is, and what relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy ſoever we find in Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, we muſt conclude for the Affirmative, That we are to love even our enemies, and to exerciſe all the good Offices of love to them that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37302:113"/>
we can, ſaving the due Order of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; according unto, and admitting for good, the reaſon of <hi>Marchantius,</hi> We muſt love our Enemies (ſaith he) by vertue of this Precept, which bids us to love our Neighbors, <hi>Quia nomine proximi non ſolum intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligitur Amicus, ſed quilibet homo vivens:</hi> Under the Name of our Neighbour is underſtood, not only our Neighbour that dwelleth by us, but every Man living; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence our Enemies are to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (in that ſenſe) for our Neighbors; and accordingly loved. This Divine Precept is not only expreſſed, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the Law of Grace, but was in force under the Moſaical and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Laws. In the Moſaical Law it is ſaid <hi>(Exodus,</hi> chap. 23. to 4.) <hi>Si occurreris bovi inimici tui, aut aſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no erranti;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou meet thine enemies Oxe or Aſs going aſtray, bring it back to him.</hi> Under a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſe or occaſion, he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a general Duty; namely, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37302:114"/>
where we have opportunity to do our enemy a good office, we fail not to do it, out of our love, and good will to him. In the Prophetical Law it is ſaid, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Si eſurierit inimicus tuus, ciba illum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thine enemy hunger, give him meat; if he thirſt give him water to drink; for,</hi> in ſo doing, <hi>thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head, and our Lord will reward thee.</hi> Not that we ſhould intend evil to our enemy in doing him good; but to ſhew, that our doing him good ſhall be a better revenge, than if we had heap'd coals of fire on his head. For we both pleaſe God, and may expect our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for what we do; and he, if he repents not, and ceaſes to be our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy upon ſo juſt occaſion given him, muſt expect the effects of Gods diſpleaſure, firſt or laſt, to fall upon him. So likewiſe, in another place, it is ſaid, <hi>Cum ceciderit inimicus tuus, ne gaudeas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fall, be not glad thereat; and in</hi>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:37302:114"/>
                           <hi>his ruine let not thy heart rejoyce; leaſt perhaps our Lord ſee it, and it diſpleaſe him.</hi> But in the Evangelical or New Law, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth more ratifie and confirm it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 44. in theſe words; <hi>Ego autem dico vobis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I ſay unto you; love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that perſecute you, and that ſlander, or falſly accuſe you; that you may be the children of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven: who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Sun to riſe upon the good and the bad, and cauſeth it to rain upon the juſt and unjuſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>What can be more expreſs and clear? For it might (poſſibly) be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſome, concerning the Old Law, that there was nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly declared or written, that <hi>we ſhould love our Enemies,</hi> but only that we ſhould <hi>help</hi> him in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that we ſhould <hi>not revenge</hi> our ſelves, nor <hi>rejoyce</hi> in his ruine or adverſity: But in the New Teſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:37302:115"/>
it is poſitively and expreſly ſaid, <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned out of S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> which the Evangeliſt S. <hi>Luke</hi> alſo confirms (Chap. 6. v. 27.) in the like words; <hi>Love</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, do good to them that hate you, bleſs them that curſe you,</hi> and <hi>pray for them that calumniate you.</hi> Nay more than this: The Goſpel, or New Law, requires ſo great equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, patience, and good affection of mind towards thoſe that hate us, and treat us injuriouſly, and that we be ſo far from revenging our ſelves, that it requires us, when we are ſtricken on the one Cheek, to offer alſo the other. For ſo this Evangeliſt (S. <hi>Luke)</hi> writeth, Chap. 6. v. 29. <hi>Et qui te percutit in maxillam, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he &amp; alteram; When one ſtrikes you on one Cheek, give him the other alſo to ſtrike.</hi> In fine, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment or full performance of this Precept, we muſt know, that as in relation to our Neighbour, we are
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37302:115"/>
to love him, <hi>corde, ore, &amp; opere</hi> (in heart, in word, and in deed;) ſo muſt we alſo do towards our enemy: We muſt in heart wiſh him as much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as to our ſelves: we muſt in our actions do them as much good, as we would have done to our ſelves in like caſe; we muſt not defame, ſlander, injure, or do them any harm in our words; but in all our expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and ſpeech of them, tender their good and their juſt concerns as our own. So that although our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hate us, yet we in charity are to love them; and though they curſe us, we are to bleſs them; though they perſecute and trouble us, we muſt forgive them, and pray for them; if they be wicked, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not us to be good; if they be our enemies, yet the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obliges us to be their friends.</p>
                        <p>Theſe things (I doubt not) will ſeem to many extream hard to be perform'd, ſuch is humane w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

and that for Gods ſake: for ſo is Gods Commandment. We muſt be not only content, but willing, with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> to ſay <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 16. v. 14.) <hi>Propter verba labiorum tuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ego cuſto divi vias duras: For the words of thy lips I have kept hard ways;</hi> that is to ſay, by reaſon of thy Commandment I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my ſelf, and kept the narrow way of vertue, how hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſoever I found it to Fleſh and Bloud: Becauſe thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, I have loved, and will ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to love even mine Enemies, and to purſue them with kindneſſes, as much as they perſecute me with words, and deeds of hatred: all this I will do to fulfil your Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to gain the more intereſt in your love. Nor will any good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian think it much, or a hard thing, to love his Enemies, that well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the matter, and ſets before his eyes the example of Chriſt upon the Croſs. None had greater Enemies
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37302:116"/>
than he; no Innocent perſon was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſecuted ſo maliciouſly, ſo cauſleſly; none ever ſuffered more contrary to all juſtice, right, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, at the hands of his Enemies; and yet even upon the Croſs, while he lay under the greateſt pain, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſhame, that their hatred and ill will could poſſibly bring upon him, and was breathing out his Soul, with the extremity of it; yet even then he loved them, and did the beſt offices he could for them to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; namely, praying for them, and excuſing, in ſome part, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſin, in theſe words; (Luke 23. v. 34.) <hi>Pater, dimitte il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; non enim ſciunt quid faciunt; Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> Thus did the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World requite the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his Enemies; thus did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay all their revilings, curſings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, all their cruel, barbarous, and deſpiteful uſage; to wit, by the greateſt charity and good will ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37302:117"/>
on their behalf, his love contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gloriouſly triumphing over their hatred. I do not doubt, but having ſuch an object of Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, and excited by ſuch an example, we will deſire above all things to imitate, and be like unto him: his moſt perfect goodneſs du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, will work in us the like affection; ſo as it ſhall not be grievous unto us to follow his ſteps, <hi>per vias duas,</hi> in any kind of vertue, though never ſo hard to fleſh and bloud, and particularly not in this, of loving, for the future, thoſe that we have at preſent in averſion.</p>
                        <p>Our Saviours moſt perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd example alone might ſerve for this: But we have ſeveral others, beſides this, in the holy Scriptures, not unworthy to be taken notice of, in order to the good effect of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and carrying our ſelves well to thoſe who deſerve not very well of us; as namely, that of the holy Patriarch <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who being well
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:37302:117"/>
beloved of his Father, was for that reaſon ſo hated of the reſt of his Brethren, that (as the holy Text ſpeaketh of them) <hi>Non poterant ei quicquam pacifice loqui, They were not able to ſpeak a good or peaceable word to him,</hi> (Gen. 37. 4.) but were perpetually quarrelling and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him; till at length their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion grew to ſuch a height, that they conſpired his death (v. 19, 20.) caſting him firſt (in order to that end) into a Ciſtern (or certain dry Pit) in the Wilderneſs, and afterwards ſold him to the Iſhmaelites (to be their Bond-ſlave) <hi>Viginti argenteis</hi> (for <hi>Twenty pieces of Silver)</hi> (v. 28.) yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> took all theſe doings well, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated not revenge, though it was in his power to have done it; but when his Brethren were fall'n into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, by reaſon of the Famine, he provided for them and their Families all manner of Food; and when his Brethren did not know <hi>Joſeph</hi> their Brother, he made himſelf known to
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:37302:118"/>
them in this kind manner, excuſing their iniquity towards him: <hi>Accedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ad me, nolite pavere; Ego ſum Joſeph Frater vester, &amp;c.</hi> (Gen. 45. v. 3, 4, 5.) <hi>Come near unto me, I pray you; be not troubled, I am Joſeph your Brother, whom ye ſold into</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: <hi>Is my Father yet alive?—</hi>and <hi>let it not ſeem grievous to you, that you ſold me; for God ſent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before you to preſerve you alive. Non veſtro conſilio, ſed Dei volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It was not ſo much by your deſign, as by the will of God, that I was ſent hither.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Load your Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>go up to my Father into the Land of</hi> Canaan; <hi>and bring him, and all your Kindred, from thence;</hi> and <hi>I will give you of all the good things in</hi> Egypt: <hi>and you ſhall eat the marrow of the Land.</hi> Thus did the good <hi>Joſeph</hi> requite the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind wickedneſs and ill-will of his Brethren with love.</p>
                        <p>But what ſhall we ſay of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Prophet, King <hi>David?</hi> how much
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37302:118"/>
was he hated by <hi>Saul,</hi> and how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perſecuted by him to ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that he was in imminent danger of his life thereby, yet he never hated <hi>Saul</hi> upon that account, but did him all the good Offices he could; ſaving him ſeveral times when he was in his power, and that <hi>David</hi> might at once have ridded himſelf of a cruel Enemy, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Crown, Scepter, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; to which he had right ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, being by Gods ſpecial appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anointed King over <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſucceed after <hi>Saul.</hi> The good King found his Enemy faſt aſleep, his Spear fixed in the ground at his head; and <hi>Abner,</hi> with all the reſt of his people, ſleeping about him; yet would he not hurt him: And when <hi>Abiſai,</hi> one of the Captains of King <hi>David,</hi> offer'd himſelf to diſpatch <hi>Saul</hi> at one blow, alledging ſome ſhew of reaſon for it; Becauſe <hi>God had now deliver'd his Enemy into his hands, and he ought not to neglect the opportunity which</hi>
                           <pb n="218" facs="tcp:37302:119"/>
                           <hi>Providence gave him of ſecuring himſelf: David</hi> would by no means liſten to the motion, but forbad him doing any ſuch thing, in theſe expreſs words: 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Kill him not. For who can extend his hand againſt the anointed of our Lord, and be innocent! Vivit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus, quia niſi Dominus percuſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit eum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As our Lord liveth, unleſs God ſhall strike him,</hi> he ſhall not be ſtricken by me; or <hi>that his day come to die,</hi> or <hi>that deſcending into a Battle he periſh (ſo God be merciful to me) I will not lift up my hand againſt our Lords Anointed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The New Teſtament wants not innumerable other Examples of this kind; namely the Examples of all the holy Martyrs, both of ancient and late Times; who following the Example of Chriſt our Saviour, have ever prayed for their Enemies and Perſecutors, with ſuch fervent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and ardent Charity, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often their Enemies and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37302:119"/>
have been converted by that means, and become great Saints and Martyrs themſelves. Look but into the Acts of the Apoſtles, there you preſently meet with the Bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> in the midſt of his Sufferings praying for his Enemies in theſe words <hi>(Acts</hi> 7. v. 60.) <hi>Domine, ne ſtatuas illis hoc peccatum. Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> The effect of which Prayer was (beſides other not mentioned) the preſent Converſion of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> one of his greateſt Perſecutors. For behold, while he was in his greateſt fury a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſtians, and poſting in all haſte to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Deſign to make havock of the poor Church there (as we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4, 17.) Chriſt appeared to him, ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou me?</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I ſhould have loſt thee, ſtanding ſo much againſt me and my name: But my Servant and Martyr,</hi> Stephen, <hi>praying for thee, for his ſake, you are</hi>
                           <pb n="220" facs="tcp:37302:120"/>
                           <hi>a choſen Veſſel unto me; and ſhall bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and Children of</hi> Iſrael. In the ſame manner, and for like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is reported by Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> of Saint <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, that he who lead him to the Execution of his Martyrdom, was ſo much moved with the great zeal and conſtancy of this holy Apoſtle, that he ask'd him forgiveneſs for what he was to have done; which the bleſſed Apoſtle moſt willingly gave him, embracing him, and ſaying to him, <hi>Pax tibi ſit, Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Peace be with thee, my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> At which Salutation the poor man was ſo animated and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he forthwith publickly profeſſed himſelf to be a Chriſtian; and was upon that Confeſſion made a Martyr: having his head likewiſe cut off.</p>
                        <p>Let theſe few Examples ſuffiſe to give you ſtrength and courage to do the ſame, whenſoever occaſion ſhall require it of you. At all times let us be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37302:120"/>
prompt, and willing to forgive our enemies, ſeeing God is ſo ready at all times to forgive us, having penitent recourſe unto him. Be not of the number of thoſe, who, when duty requires of them to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt, and to forgive, and love their enemies, make their excuſe, and ſay Chriſt was God, and moſt Divinely perfect, and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in all goodneſs; but they are weak men, and cannot reach ſo high perfection, as to forgive, and love enemies, perſecutors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in vain it is for them to uſe ſuch ſpeech, it will not ſerve their turn, it will be no juſt apology for them at the latter day. And verily it is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, how ſuch perſons can ſay their <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> or how they can addreſs themſelves to God to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, in the terms they do: For they ſay, <hi>Dimitte nobis debita noſtra, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut &amp; nos dimitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Forgive your enemies, as you would be forgiven of God; Love your enemies as you deſire that God ſhould love you. For otherwiſe I do let you all know, that who ſo hates his Neighbour, or Enemy (it matters not which, all's one in this caſe) renders himſelf uncapable of begging forgiveneſs from God; he is ſo far from obtaining his requeſt, that he cannot without moſt grievous ſin, and entangling his Soul with further guilt, make ſuch a requeſt: unleſs we do firſt lay aſide all hatred, by loving, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning, and forgiving our enemies in heart, 'tis in vain for us to expect any mercy from God. It is againſt all reaſon that God ſhould love him, who is not in true Charity with all. Thoſe that wiſh harm to others, and will not forgive injuries received, it is

                        <p>As to the Third Affection propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Saint <hi>Vincentius,</hi> men ought to have a quiet and ſetled patience, willingly contenting themſelves to ſuffer all vexations, troubles, and injuries, that ſhall be done to them; being alwayes ready to forgive them: of which kind of affections, or love; I have in part already ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the fore-going Paragraphs; as namely, that we ſhould love our enemies, do good to them that hate us, pray for them that perſecute and calumniate us; forget, and with all our heart forgive injuries, and the like. I have only this one thing to adde further in this place, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the point of loving our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and doing good to them, that<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this affection may be found true, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:37302:124"/>
and meritorious of Divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it muſt be operative and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; it muſt not reſt, or contain it ſelf only in well-wiſhing, but muſt extend to well-doing alſo. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you not what hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid? to wit, that we muſt love o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (our Neighbours, our Enemies) <hi>as we love our ſelves.</hi> Now in loving our ſelves we do not think it enough, meerly to wiſh good, or pray for good to ones ſelf, but we are diligent, and careful to uſe our beſt endeavours to help our ſelves what we can; and to deſire, that all others, that can, would alſo help us. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the duty of true Charity obligeth us, not only to wiſh good, but to do good, to our Neighbours, to our Enemies, and to all others that want the good we can do them. For if we only wiſh, and do nothing, we trifle; our wiſhes ſerving for nothing, but to bring us under the cenſure and reproof of Saint <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, which he uſeth againſt ſuch like peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37302:124"/>
in theſe words <hi>(Jac.</hi> 2. v. 15.) <hi>Si autem frater, aut ſoror nudi ſint,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If a brother, or ſiſter, be naked, and lack daily food, and one of you ſay to them, Go in peace, be warmed, be fill'd with meat; but you give them not the things, that are neceſſary for the Body, what ſhall it profit?</hi> It will not ſatisfie the Belly, to ſay <hi>Eat,</hi> where nothing is given to eat; nor keep off the Cold, to ſay <hi>Be warm, be cloathed,</hi> to one that hath no Cloaths to put on. In like manner neither can we merit any thing with God, only by wiſhing good to another, and not doing him the good that is in our power to do. Therefore we are not only to wiſh good, but to do good, ſo far as we are able, to our Neighbous, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all men living; and not only to pray for them, but alſo to aſſiſt and help them in their neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as God ſhall enable us.</p>
                        <p>The third Affection or Love men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by Saint <hi>Vincentius,</hi> requires
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:37302:125"/>
that we uſe gentle and benign beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and affability towards all men as reaſon requires; demeaning our ſelves in converſation amongſt men as becometh Chriſtians, with courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, reſpect, mildneſs, not giving any ſign of anger or offence of mind, nor of contempt and diſreſpect to any, but wiſhing well in our hearts to all; to afford all convenient teſtimony and demonſtration thereof, both in our words and deeds; for ſo the Bleſſed Apoſtle requires (1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 3. 18.) <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, non diligamus verbo, neque lingua, ſed opere &amp; veritate. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let us love not ſo much in word and tongue as in work and in truth.</hi> He doth not forbid us to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our love and good will to others by words and by our tongue, but to take heed that our love lies not wholly in our Tongue, that it be not only a feigned love of outward profeſſion, and not in deed and truth. This affection is likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly exerciſed in judging of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:37302:125"/>
mens actions in the better ſenſe, in concealing and keeping ſecret their faults and imperfections, ſupporting their infirmities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> conſidering that we our ſelves are infirm and weak; frailties and imperfections are to be found in our ſelves as well as others; and mutual Charity in this kind is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite on both ſides. Verily it is no eaſie matter to converſe with men (I mean thoſe of worldly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation) without tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or giving offence: For which reaſon it behoveth us prudently to comply with every one, for the Love of God, and (as much as is poſſible) to have a quiet and ſettled patience in their infirmities, being always more ready to pardon, paſs by, and over-ſee, what happens to be amiſs (ſo far as juſt reaſon and charity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits) then to check or reprove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably and with offence. What the Apoſtle ſays <hi>(Galat.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 2.) is good counſel for us all. <hi>Alter alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius onera portate. Bear ye one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

                           <hi>burthens, and ſo you ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Law of Chriſt.</hi> And truly with great reaſon it is required of us, that ſeeing we all deſire to have our own defects and frailties covered, our own infirmities ſupported, our ignorances excus'd, and our offences forgiven; we ſhould do the ſame unto others, ſupporting one another and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another; but above all things having the true Charity of God one towards another; which, where it rules, <hi>is the bond of Perfection; Coloſ.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
                        <p>The fifth ſort of Love or Affection which the good Author Saint <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſuggeſts to us, is to have an humble and reverent regard towards all men, according to their dignity and quality, eſteeming them all (as they are) for our betters; yielding them place, and ſubmitting our ſelves with all our hearts to them, as juſtice and charity requires; giving them willingly all the honour, reſpect and reverence, which their qualities,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:37302:126"/>
dignities, ſtates and conditions do merit: If they be our equals and no more, it ſuffices that with candour and all ſincerity of good will, we treat them, and carry our ſelves to them as we in like caſe would be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and convers'd with by others. Thus doing, we ſhall in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner correſpond, not only with that general and moſt equal precept of the Goſpel <hi>(Luc.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 31.) <hi>Prout vult is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        <p>As to the Holy Saint <hi>Vincentius</hi> his ſixth ſort of Love and Affection, it obliges us to be at perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all Men, and to live in Concord and Amity with all, ſo much as it is in our power to do, and ſo far forth as our Concord and Amity with others may not diſpleaſe God or tend to his diſhonour; for if it does, ſuch Amities are to be broken off. <hi>There is no Concord betwixt Chriſt and Belial.</hi> (2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15.) We muſt ſay the ſelf ſame thing with other Chriſtians ſo long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Catholique Faith; but if they will depart from it either in whole or in part, we are not then to ſay as they ſay, but to ſay <hi>Anathema</hi> to them and to all their wicked er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. We are to agree with men in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37302:128"/>
good not in evil, in the Truth and in the ſound Doctrine of Chriſtian Catholique Faith, not in Devilliſh er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

                        <p>Seeing that the Love of God muſt be predominant over all other Loves, and reign over all our Paſſions, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Luſts, Deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as we have already declared; it cannot but ſeem reaſonable, and a thing to be wiſh'd for by all ſuch perſons as do ſeriouſly concern themſelves in things of the Spirit, that we ſhould, at leaſt in brief, point at and ſhew them the means how by Gods Grace they may come to a pious and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance, that they do truly love God above all things, and by conſequence that their hearts are free from the peſtilent and dangerous Vice of Self-love: To ſatisfie whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, I think it neceſſary to add a word or two further upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, In the general I ſay, that to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37302:130"/>
proceed ſecurely in this matter, it behoves us exactly, and without all partiality, to conſider what the courſe of our lives hath been and is, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bend our affections, inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſires, what is the intent and deſign of all our actions; for if theſe either wholly or at leaſt principally tend unto and be directed to Gods Honour, to the health of our Souls, and to the gaining of a good Eternity, all's well; we walk ſafely, and may promiſe our ſelves good from God. As on the contrary, If we find our lives to be diſſolute and careleſs, and our mind more ſet upon Vanity and the things of the World than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, we muſt fear the worſt, yea know for certain, that as to our Spiritual Eſtate, things go not well with us. The predominant affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in us, will eaſily ſhew what we are, and to whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Amongſt Men of the World we ſee, that for the moſt part, in every one of them, ſome paſſion or other
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:37302:131"/>
(one or more) predominates over all the reſt, and makes ſuch perſons to be accordingly eſteem'd, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varitious, ſome ambitious, ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous and given wholly to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, others extravagant and humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and as much over-born with fancy; finally, others too much re-ſenting and apt to revenge; all which are ſo denominated and judged from their principal Love, and the Affection which they do principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear, and ſhew either towards Riches or Honours, Worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pleaſures, and the like; the whole conduct of mens lives being as it were tinctur'd or rather tainted with that principal Affection which reigns in them.</p>
                        <p>This ſhews us our ſelves, for in the ſame manner it is with us: No man hath reaſon to think himſelf free from Self-love, or that he loveth God above all things (which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation) if examining
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37302:131"/>
his life, his actions, his employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, deſires, and pretenſions, he do not find the principal bent, frame, and deſign of them to be towards God; and that his Honour and our eternal good are the things chiefly look't at by us. The love which we bare to God, muſt be a Love not of bear Words, not vain tranſitory Thoughts which periſh and come to nothing; but it muſt be a Love of Effects, a Love that produceth good Actions and good Works, It muſt not be an idle Love, nor a talking, nor a vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a working Love, a diligent and induſtrious Love; a Love that loves to be doing, to be always buſie and imployed in the works of love: And therefore we muſt take heed that we do not deceive our ſelves in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the acts of our Underſtanding for the acts of Love or Divine Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. There is not a mortal man living (that hath the uſe of reaſon) whoſe underſtanding does not tell him that he ought to love God more
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37302:132"/>
than himſelf; yea, there is not a true man who hath not ſome inclination of Will, though weak, faint, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, to love God more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and yet for all that want the true Grace of God, for as much as we muſt know, that the Love of God doth not conſiſt in that act of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor in thoſe inclinations of Will, but it conſiſts altogether in putting the ſaid acts or judgments of the Underſtanding and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Will in practice; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if we want thoſe things which are the proper effects and fruits of Divine Love and Friendſhip; how can we think our ſelves to be Gods true Lovers or Friends? and if the true Love of God dwells not in us, 'tis certain that Self-love and Self-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt doth. By this therefore we may judge whether we have the true love of God or not, or whether we be not ſtill under the domi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ion of Self-love. For the acts and proper effects of Divine Love (as all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:37302:132"/>
teach) are to be united in our affections to God, and in all things to look at him as our chief and only good: If it be thus with us, we love God, if otherwiſe, we love our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>This is one Rule, (and I think, the principal) whereby to know, what our condition is in order to God, and whether we be free from Self-love: Yet I think it not amiſs to mention ſome others, that I obſerve to be re-commended by pious and learned Men. According to F. <hi>Creſſy,</hi> the property of true Divine Love is to unite all our affections to God, and to make them all one in him, as in our Chief and Soveraign Good: and that out of this love we are to take joy in his Divine Perfections and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and that he is, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, ſo adored and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in heaven by the Angels, and by all Saints. Beſides this we are (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame good Author
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:37302:133"/>
to deſire, and (occaſion being given) to endeavour ſo much as in us lies, that all Creatures, acording to their ſeveral capacities, may ſerve, love, and adore him; That the Infidels, Heretiques, and all Sinners, may be converted to him, and truly repent of their diſobedience and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; that ſo, by love, he may reign in all hearts, and all hearts be ſad for the offences (of their own or others) committed againſt him.</p>
                        <p>In pure love to him we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine faithfully to ſerve him, and to take joy in all things that pleaſe him. Moreover with indifferency we are to accept all things from his hands, and to take them in good part; as well things diſpleaſing and offenſive to Nature, as pleaſing. It is required of us all to be heartily ſorry for all things, that are done, or happen, contrary to his Divine Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; to love all things that are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, and pertaining to his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:37302:133"/>
Honour, his Service, and his Glory; and that meerly for his ſake we ſhould love all men, yea even our Enemies and Perſecutors; doing our endeavour alſo (where we judge it convenient) to expreſs ſome effects of love to them, more than to others, as being ſpecial Inſtruments, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us greater good from God, than thoſe Friends, who do all they can to pleaſe us, and to foment and flatter us in vain things.</p>
                        <p>It is expected from us, that we do all the honour we can to Almighty God, and all the ſervice, and good offices in our power, to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for his Sake; in nothing ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own commodities, further then his Goodneſs allows; but in all things his good pleaſure. We muſt imitate and follow his holy Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in all kind of Vertues and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to our utmoſt poſſibility: and particularly it ſhould be our Deſign to love others, with the like Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:37302:134"/>
of love, wherewith he loved us, without looking to our own profit, or intereſt in loving. He loved us meerly for our good, not for his own; ſo ſhould we love our Neighbour; pretending nothing, but to do him good by our love, and not our ſelves. We muſt reſolve, never to accept any contentment but in him, nor other happineſs, but in himſelf alone. We muſt not ſet bounds to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our love; but ſtill endeavour to love him more, and better.</p>
                        <p>We are to be reſigned, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſuffer for him in this State of Mortality; being contented for the preſent only with the hope of Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afterward, that is, in Heaven. We are to hate our ſelves, our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vicious Nature, our bad Inclinations, our Unſenſibleneſs of his great Mercy and Goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a moſt perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, never being weary of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting and mortifying our ſelves. We
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:37302:134"/>
are bound to love him equally in his Commandements, as his Rewards, and to rejoyce, or take contentment in any act of Temporal Severity, exerciſed by him upon us. We are never to ceaſe praying, that God would ſhew us the defectouſneſs of our love, and that he would daily give us his grace, more and more to encreaſe, both in the degrees of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Purity.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Marks, the Signs, the Fruits, and real Effects of the True Love of God; and by them we may perceive, when and whether or no we be free from the peſt of Self-love, Self-eſteem, Self-ſeeking, and Self-pleaſing. This little, which hath been ſaid, will ſerve to ſhew our ſtate, if we conſider it well. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſs! where ſhall we find a Soul, that can ſhew all theſe (or the moſt part of theſe) Rules exactly obſerv'd, and practiſed by her<hi>!</hi> However, our duty is to aſpire to all Perfection, and to

the Practice of all theſe good Rules and Helps thereto, as much as may be; yet as to the meaſure of our Perfection, ſubmitting our ſelves, and being reſigned therein to the Will of God; of whoſe grace it is, that we attain to any meaſure, or degree of perfection: For ſo is his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſure.</p>

A Feavor, or Spirituall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, this is, ſo malignant, that it cauſeth many other Diſeaſes, and Dangerous Symptoms of Soul, to Mankind: as for example, many Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloryings, many and much Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boaſting, and Vaunting of ons Self; much Flattering of others, much Wantonneſs, much Hypocricy and Diſſembling, innumerable Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies and Curioſities of like nature, frequent Ingratiudes, frequent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obediencies to thoſe in lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, frequent Seditions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions publique, frequent Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conteſts more private, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Diſreſpects to Superiours, and Deſpiſings of Equals, and thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us; together with many other

                        <p>The firſt that ever was troubled with theſe Diſtempers (to wit of Pride and Ambition) was <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that reprobate Angel, together with all his wicked Crew: who through the exceſs of Pride, and the inordinate Love and conceit of his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, extolled himſelf to ſuch a height, as to pretend to be equal to God; according to the relation which is given of him by the Prophet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> (Chap. 14. v. 14.) where the wicked Angel ſaith thus in his heart, <hi>In Coelum conſcendam, ſuper aſtra Dei exaltabo ſolium meum,</hi> &amp;c. I
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:37302:138"/>

I will aſcend above the height of the Clouds, I will be like the Moſt High.</hi> His Pride was ſuch, that he affected to be Gods rival in every thing, and whereſoever Gods Throne was (whether in Heaven or in Earth) there would he ſet his throne. But this preſumption of his caſt him down into Hell, and of a bright Angel transformed him into a black Devil: for ſo we read <hi>(Jud. Ep.</hi> v. 6.) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos vero,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He keepeth now in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting chains under darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c.

he could no longer bear the ſhape of an Angel, he takes that of a Serpent, and therein ſets upon our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in Paradice, overthrowing and deceiving them by his fair but falſe words, ſpecious, but pernicious illuſions; perſwading them that if they would but eat of the forbidden Fruit, they ſhould be (ſtrait ways) like unto God; for ſo we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Deus enim ſcit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith that wicked deceiver and lier) <hi>doth know that in the day you eat of that Fruit, your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil:</hi> which words of his ſo pleaſed our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> that ſhe preſently fell into a longing after that promotion and priviledge he ſpake of, deſiring the likeneſs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of God; whereupon ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily yieldeth to his remptation, out of a perverſe deſire of knowing more things than did belong to her; and being deceiv'd her ſelf, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades her Husband alſo <hi>(Adam)</hi> to do

                           <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, meerly through his Pride and exceſſive Ambition, ſhake and trouble the whole World, endeavouring to reduce the ſame to the obedience of one only Monarchy, and to keep it in ſubjection under his own ſole Government: Was it not out of the ſame unquiet humor of Pride and reſtleſs Ambition that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſo much diſquieted all the Roman Empire?

                        <p>But leaving profane Hiſtory, let us reflect upon what the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures report in relation to this matter. In the ſecond Book of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> you may read, Chap. 9. v. 25. of King <hi>Solomon,</hi> how that he exceeded all the Princes and Monarchs of the Earth, in Royal Magnificence and Powers: The particular inſtances of his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would be innumerable and too many to rehearſe; therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, I will only take notice of this, That whenſoever he thought good to appear in his Royal State and Dignity, he had for that purpoſe always ready to attend him, <hi>Forty thouſand Horſes in the Stables, and Cbariots and Horſemen Twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi>
                           <pb n="265" facs="tcp:37302:142"/>
But alas! to what end comes all this Worldly Pomp, Splendor, and Magnificence? if they eſcape the judgment which this Great and Wiſe King doth (himſelf) threaten to the Proud and High-minded <hi>(Prov.</hi> 16. 18.) <hi>Pride goeth before deſtruction, and a haughty mind before a fall,</hi> yet they ſhall never avoid what the Prophet <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 14. 11.) ſhews to be the end of all Worldly Glory. <hi>Subter te ſternetur tinea, &amp; operimentum tuum erant vermes. The Moth is ſpred under thee, and Worms are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy covering:</hi> That is, if they fall not by ſome ſpecial and ſudden judgment of God, that puts an end to their Pride before they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of it, yet moſt certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably they muſt at length yield to that which is the end of all Fleſh, to wit, Corruption. The Pomp and Splendor of this World will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endure. <hi>Moſes, (Numb.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 30.) ſeems to fore-warn this to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> telling them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:37302:143"/>
that the Soul which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends <hi>through Pride,</hi> ſhall in no ſort ſcape unpuniſhed.

He that ſins out of Pride, or with an high hand, he muſt bear his iniquity, whoever he be, native or ſtranger, he muſt be cut off from his People.</p>
                        <p>Behold therefore here, and conſider the unhappy end of Pride; it is, for the moſt part, but the fore-runner of Deſtruction, which the Scripture further confirms by the example of that Proud Man <hi>Haman,</hi> who was hang'd upon the ſame Gibbet which he in the pride and inſelency of his haughty mind, had prepared for the humble <hi>Mordocheus, Eſther,</hi> 7. 10. The like end happened to the proud <hi>Holofernes,</hi> who having conquered ſo many Provinces and ſubdued ſo much People, only to ſatisfie his own and his Maſters Pride, was at laſt

                        <p>It might be thought Pride were a Diſeaſe proper or incident only to Great Perſons, Men and Women, and that for thoſe of inferiour and mean condition, as their fortune is low, ſo their minds ſhould not be high. But experience tells us 'tis otherwiſe, and therefore having hitherto repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in part the Vanity, Pride, and Ambition, that is in Women of high Quality and plentiful Fortune, I ſhall conclude with a word of Admonition to thoſe of meaner Rank, only to ſhew them, that if Pride be an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vice, and unſeemly even in the greateſt Perſons (for Honour, Wealth, and Dignity) that live upon the Earth, it muſt be much more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and intollerable in them.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:37302:148"/>
and Proud, to be in Great Office, in Great Power, Dignity, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Proud, is a Humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, more to be pittied than blamed by Wiſe Men; but to be poor and Proud is monſtrous, a diſcongruity purely and manifeſtly ſatanical. What ſhall we ſay of ſuch People, whom Fortune hath not favoured in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or meaſure, with the purvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and endowments, that Pride and Ambition uſually ſtands upon, and yet they are proud? Truly we may ſay they are the worſt ſort of Proud People, their Pride is more criminous and leſs excuſable than that of others; and if we ſay this with truth, we need not, we can ſay no more to their condemnation.</p>
                        <p>And yet how common a thing is it to ſee this Helliſh Prodigy in the World? how eaſie and frequent to obſerve the effects of higheſt Pride in the loweſt Condition; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of others, what ſcornings and diſdainings, what vilifyings and

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:37302:151"/>
is, in all ſorts of Chriſtians, in all Degrees, in all Orders, in all States and Conditions of Men; there is none entirely free from the infection of this Peſt; inſomuch, that the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> reflecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and bemoaning the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſtianity, by means thereof, in concluſion adds, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Prieſt-hood was not free from it. <hi>Etiam in Sinu Sacerdotum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio dormit.</hi> Ambition (ſaith he) ſleeps even in the Boſom of Prieſts. This he ſpake to ſhew the growth of the Malady, and no wonder; for Satan (we know) when time was, had the boldneſs to tempt Chriſt himſelf with this ſuggeſtion, to that end ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and there ſhewing him <hi>all the Kingdoms of the World and the Glory of them;</hi> ſaying to him <hi>(Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>Omnia haec tibi dabo,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All theſe things will I give thee</hi> (I will make thee King of the whole World, thou ſhalt be the only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch

upon Earth, no Greatneſs ſhall be comparable to yours) <hi>if you will fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Thus he tempts our Saviour with a motion of Pride, and deſire to be great; and though he were ſhamefully rebuked for his bold attempt, and departed with confuſion enough from Chriſt, yet his Diſciples could not ſo well perceive or reſiſt his wiles. To be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown by the Maſter did but whet his Appetite to be reveng'd on the Servants; and therefore he wrought the matter ſo, that it was not long before there fell <hi>a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the Diſciples which of them ſhould be greateſt, Luc.</hi> 22. <hi>v.</hi> 24. That is, a Spirit of Pride and Ambition got in amongſt them; and it is no leſs to be fear'd that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Zebedaeus</hi> Ghildren and her Sons were taken with the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when ſhe made that extravagant requeſt to our Saviour, which is mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 21. name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that her two Sons might ſit the</hi>

your original is from the Ground, from a Lump of Clay or Dirt, of which the Almighty Creator fram'd and made our firſt Parents; that you are for the preſent a maſs of ſuitable ſordid Fleſh, living indeed, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very hour and every moment ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death, and to all the accidents, diſeaſes, and corruptions, by which death uſually is uſher'd in; and for the future you ſhall be (as to your Body) nothing elſe but Putrefaction and Filth. In the Grave you ſhall be nothing elſe but a ſtinking Carcaſs, and meat for Worms; for ſo in the Prophet it is ſaid, when a Man dies he ſhall inherit Serpents (or creeping things) Beaſts and Worms. Tell me now have you any reaſon to be Proud and ſo high minded? Have you any reaſon to carry your ſelves ſo high, that are of an extraction ſo low; God could have Created your Bodies of nothing, as he did your Souls, but in his Wiſdom he would not; but made them of the Earth, that is,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:37302:158"/>
not only of a ſubſtance Corporal, Groſs, Viſible, Palpable (to be ſeen with our Eyes and touched with our Hands) but of the vileſt ſort of Earth, of the Clay, the Dirt and Slime of the Earth. Do you ask me why? To teach us Humility, and to repreſs the Swellings of Pride in us; that Man ſeeing daily with his Corporal Eyes, the Dirt upon which he treads, might continually be put in mind, and remember his firſt Creation, his firſt Original and Beginning, and how that he was made and formed of the ſame; and this for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, The firſt (as I ſaid before) that hereby he might give to man a juſt occaſion of humbling himſelf with the moſt profound ſubmiſſion and abnegation that mans heart can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bend it ſelf unto, even ſo far as to confeſs and acknowledge that of himſelf he deſerveth nothing but to be concullated, trodden and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon, under the feet of all men, as the Dirt of the Earth, as Mire and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:37302:159"/>
Clay; and that for this reaſon, he hath nothing of himſelf to be proud and high-minded for; ſince his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal foundation and extraction is but Dirt, and the Slime of the earth. The ſecond reaſon why God made Man of the Dirt of the Earth, is, That by reflecting upon that his firſt Creation, he might be mov'd ſo much the more to love his Gracious Maker, and more faithfully to ſerve his Mighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who of his infinite Goodneſs and Mercy, from ſuch a vile and mean beginning (as Earth and Dirt) was pleaſed to raiſe him to that height of Excellency, as to conſummate his Creation, and finally, to <hi>make him according to his own image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

                        <p>IN the whole multitude and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Maladies and Diſeaſes of Mind, under which, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof the Life and Vigour of Chriſtianity doth ſo much languiſh at this day, there is ſcarce any more frequent and Epidemical than that of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:37302:160"/>
over-valuing our ſelves, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning others. Hard it is, eſpecially for Perſons that ſeem conſcious to themſelves of any merit, to have (I ſay, not mean, but) modeſt thoughts of themſelves, and not to be tickled ever and anon with extravagant ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of their proper Excellency; and where the humor is indulg'd and yielded unto, the other, to wit, the contemning and under-valving of our Neighbour, follows naturally. He that tempts us to think too well of our ſelves, will eaſily find a way to make us think too meanly of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to prefer our ſelves before them. This therefore is a general Malady amongſt all ſorts of Men; Jews and Pagans, Turks, Infidels, and Chriſtians; all are obnoxious to it, and for the moſt part periſh by it, for not applying the Unguent of Humility, and Sobriety of Spirit, in due time.</p>
                        <p>But you are to know there are two ſorts of Contempt, the one tending
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:37302:161"/>
to Good, the other tending to Evil. By the firſt we condemn the World and all the Evil that belongs to it, or is found therein; by this we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn Sin, and diſdain to ſubmit or yield to the occaſions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto Sin, that are laid in our way, or that lead Men into Sin. With this kind of Contempt (as Saint <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> well obſerves) the Faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God may lawfully, and with much right deſpiſe whatſoever is hurtful to his Soul, by whomſoever ſuggeſted, and thoſe will not fail to do ſo, who have their <hi>Noviſſima, their laſt things,</hi> to wit, Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell, in due manner before their Eyes. By the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond we contemn our Neighbour, that is, other Perſons, whom by the Commandment of God we are bound to Honour, and by the Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Humily (if it were in us) we would Honour and Love accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeveral and reſpective States, Conditions, Dignities, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:37302:161"/>
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this we are apt to have in ſcorn, and to flight whatſoeveris doneby others (or not done by our ſelves) as mean and illaudable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (perhaps) never ſo well done, and very profitable for Soul or Body. This is a wicked ſort of Contempt, and abſolutely forbidden. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from Evil, and tends to Evil, and is wholly Evil. This is that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemical Vice under which the World hath ever laboured, and doth labour at this day; all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the pooreſt to the richeſt, more or leſs being ſeized therewith. This all Nations finds to be true; but (to our ſhame it muſt be ſpoken) none hath more felt, no Nation hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon to confeſs and acknowledge this Truth, than this of <hi>England,</hi> where none can be ignorant with what exorbitancy this Vice did both reign and rage for many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of late times; the very low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and meaneſt ſort of People, Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,

and Officers of the Kingdom received a ſpecial Command from the King <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> her Husband, to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, Crowned and in her Royal Attire, ſhe would not obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand (though ſhe were both his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Wife) but refuſed to come; contemning at once both his Royal Command and Loving Requeſt. But what came of her Contempt? Verily, that which Juſtice required. The King, being highly incenſed at her undutifulneſs, and to give an exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Caution or Warning to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Women not to deſpiſe their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, nor to have their Perſons and Commands in Contempt, put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from being any longer his Queen or Wife, and choſe another in her ſtead, namely Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> of the Race of the Jews.

For, as to the firſt, though I do willingly confeſs, the wickedneſs of ſinners deſerves to be abhorred of all good Chriſtians, yet I cannot but withal aver, that it may be blameable in us, to have the perſons of the Tranſgreſſors too much in contempt, or too much in hatred; Becauſe according to the rule of Chriſtianity and Charity, we ought rather to pitty, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for their perſons, imputing things (as much as may be) to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, and praying for their converſion: which if we neglect to do, I know not, but in many caſes we may offend God as much, by hating and deſpiſing their perſons upon the account of ſinne, as they do by committing the ſinne. Adde hereunto the juſt fear that we ought to have, leaſt we our ſelves fall into the ſame errours; which is poſſible enough, if we be preſumptuous,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:37302:168"/>
according to that Caveat of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. <hi>Qui ſe exiſtimat ſtare videat ne cadiat: He that thinks he ſtandeth, let him take heed, leaſt he fall;</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, What we are to day, we know: but what we ſhall be in few daies after, we are uncertain. Likewiſe, thoſe whom we have in contempt upon pretence of their evil actions, may repent, and become good: who though they begin late, yet proceeding with greater fervour and diligence, they may, with Gods help, ſoon come to ouſtrip their Deſpiſers in the way of piety and perfection, and be found at the day of Judgment better Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than we our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Things being ſo, let us contemn none, but have pitty and compaſſion of all, as occaſion requires; for fear, leaſt we fall into ſin our ſelves, and become worſe then they. But that which is worſt of all, is, that ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſatisfied to have in contempt particular perſons, upon pretence of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:37302:169"/>
ſome faults they ſee, or think they ſee in them, but they laſh out, and exerciſe their Deſpiſing humours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many, meerly for ſome relation they may have to the ſaid few, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, without any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or participation of guilt with them. For example, if one that is Maſter of a Family happen to do ſome thing that is amiſs, and which he ought to have refrain'd from doing, 'tis often ſeen, that his whole Family, Relations, and Kindred, come thereupon to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, or ill thought of by ſome; and more eſpecially thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe familiarly with him, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre ſuſpicion, and be held guilty by the many of raſh Judgers. Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that when ſome one that is a Catholique, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits a fault through Humane frailty, and tranſgreſſeth either againſt the Law of God, or of the Kingdom, though Religion and the Faith he profeſſeth be moſt pure and innocent of that Crime; yea expreſly requires,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:37302:169"/>

                        <p>This publique practice of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes good what I ſay. Who does not hear all ſorts of Sectaries here in <hi>England,</hi> Proteſtants, Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and the reſt, talking much, and objecting daily to Catholiques the Gun-powder-treaſon, as they call it. With this ſlaunder their Pulpits, and all Places ring, inſomuch that unto this day all Engliſh Catholiques are accounted, by Uncatholique People,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:37302:170"/>
little better than Traitors, upon that account; to wit, becauſe (whoever contriv'd it) there were ſome Four or Five Catholique Gentlemen engaged in it, who have long ſince ſuffered for their fault. And though King <hi>James</hi> himſelf (who then reigned) did publiquely in Parlament acquit the generality of Catholiques from having any hand in that Conſpiracy, yet ſuch is the infenſe-hatred and ill-will of moſt Engliſh Proteſtants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, we are ſtill perſecuted with ill Language, ill Suſpicions, and hard uſage upon that ſcore. They might do much better to reflect plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully upon their own Wicked and Barbarous Fact, in Murthering their own King, and ſo many of His Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects in ſeveral parts of the Kingdom; who by and through their violence, loſt their Lives and Eſtates for no other Crime but their Loyalty. This was not done by four or five private Perſons raſhly, unadviſedly, deſperately, nor yet by twenty or an
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:37302:170"/>
hundred of them (Proteſtants) but by the generality (or far Major part) of this Proteſtant Nation, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhops only excepted, and many of the Epiſcopal party, all of them (ſome very few only excepted) either immediately or mediately, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively or paſſively, either by conſent or ſufferance, concurring and being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the Kings Death, and the Death of ſo many Thouſands of their fellow Subjects, as periſhed in the late War. Neither can they produce ſo much as one Catholique Perſon in <hi>England,</hi> that had his hand in any of thoſe Bloudy Actions, but many may be produced who ſuffered all that men could ſuffer in this World, to prevent and hinder them, to the Praiſe of God and their Conſcience. Proteſtants therefore may ſee, that We (Catholiques) have greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to have their Perſons in Contempt and Hatred upon the account of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, than they ours, if that were juſtifiable; but we think it is not, and therefore proceed.</p>

commonly in Taverns and Ale-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which he knows to be Places moſt advantageous to that purpoſe: where he hath alſo for the moſt part, certain good Fellows, whom he uſeth as decoy Birds, to call or fetch in more Company, till his Nets be full.

Sold, without a Cup of good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; over which they conſult and agree about the Price: and without it ſcarce ever conclude any thing.

Labourers and Journey-men, will undertake nothing willingly, without a certain ſum of Money for to Drink caſt into the Bargain; which being freely allowed, they will do anything. So that it is plain, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be done, nothing Bought or Sold, but good Drink Seals up the

If your curioſity moves you to know the reaſon, ſeeing the Angel could as eaſily have brought him other meat to eat, and ſome other liquor to drink, more delicious and more pleaſing to the palate, yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd him with varity too, if he had pleas'd! the only reaſon of this, without queſtion was, Becauſe Bread and Water were the uſual Meat and Drink of the Prophets: they liv'd not upon delicacies and dainties; they drunk not much Wine, but uſed ſuch a repaſt, as became Men that profeſſed Temperance and Sobriety.</p>

they were not in any other kind more Eminent and Exemplary, than in the Vertues of Temperance and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity; being abſolute Maſters of both Appetites: to wit, of Gluttony and Luſt: As likewiſe it may be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider both the primitive and preſent Practice of Religious Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in their ſeveral Monaſteries and Orders, Hermits, Anchorets, and all ſorts of Aſcetiques in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in other places; we ſhall find that Sobriety and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, was their chiefeſt Study and Endeavour; all of them Labouring unanimouſly to follow their Captain, or Chief Leader, and to pleaſe him, who had called them to that Holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of Life, by Mortification and Pennance, by Faſting and Abſtinence, and by a perfect, or total ſubduing of all Cluttonous, and Carnal Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, to the Motions and Rule of Gods Spirit, propounding to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves herein, the pattern of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, of whom we have already

ſpoken ſomewhat, and of other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Men, of whom we are now to ſpeak.</p>
                        <p>And in this rank, Saint <hi>Hilarion,</hi> we think may not undeſervedly be ſet in the firſt place, either for his Age or Merit, who embraced ſuch ſtrict Abſtinence and Sobriety, even from his Youth, that by the relation of Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> when he was but fifteen years of age, he would eat nothing but Bread, and ſome few dry Figs. This courſe he held till he was about twenty, or one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years old; from which till twenty four, he ſatisfied himſelf with Lentils, ſteep'd or moiſtened with Cold Water. From twenty four to thirty, his Food was Herbs and Roots unboiled, which grew in the Wilderneſs. From thirty to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five, he lived with Barley-bread and Herbs without Oyl; at which time finding a kind of dimneſs and obſcuriry in his ſight, with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual itching all over his Body, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:37302:206"/>
with his Herbs and Roots ſome little quantity of Salt and Oyl. Thus he lived, till he had attained to the Age of Three ſcore and three years; unto which period of time he had abſtained wholly from Apples, Pears, and all other Orchard Fruits. At this age he found himſelf in a manner ſpent, and all his Body wearied, and worn to nothing; whereupon thinking with himſelf that his time was come, and that he had not long to continue in this World, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf for death; with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciple courage he reſolves to Faſt more ſtrictly than of late he had done: and thus he continued till he came to be above fourſcore, about which time he finiſhed the courſe of this mortal life, which he fuſtained with ſuch Diet as I have here mentioned and no other.</p>
                        <p>Not unlike unto him, was the life of Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> who as Saint <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> (who wrote his Life) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of him as an eye-witneſs, live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

His ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diet, for the moſt part, was Bread and Salt, and for his drink, Water: <hi>De carnibus vero &amp; vino melius tacere, quam qui cquam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere;</hi> ſaith the Author of his Life. As for Fleſh-meats and Wine, it ſeems to me better to involve that in ſilence, than to ſpeak any thing of it. The reaſon was, becauſe it was a known thing, that not only Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> but all other Monks and Aſcetiques beſide, never uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Meat or Drink. In fine, this Holy Hermit remained, for the moſt part of his Life, not only in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, or Wilderneſs, but in the more Rocky, Deſolate, and Inacceſſible Places thereof; where company could not, but with extream difficulty come to him; and ſcarce admitting

in his Old Age, the ſmall additament of a few Figs and Olives to his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diet.</p>
                        <p>What ſhall I ſay of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the firſt Hermit, and of his great Sobriety and Abſtinence<hi>!</hi> who lived in the Wilderneſs for the ſpace of a hundred and thirteen Years, in a Rocky Place, nigh unto a Fountain, of which he drank all that time, having no other Garment than of the the Palm-Tree Leaves.

Wine in all his days; no more did the Great Orator <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports be true) nor many other famous Men, of whom the Hiſtories make mention.</p>
                        <p>I find that I have dilated my ſelf ſomewhat largely, in making report of the Sobriety and Abſtinence of ſo many particular Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Ancient Fathers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renowned Men, both Chriſtians and thoſe others (morally Wiſe and Vertuous Men) among the Gentils, Kings, Captains, Philoſophers, and others. The reaſon and chief Motive hereof, hath been to ſhew the beaſtly intemperance of the Men of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age; to whom it ſeems an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, vain, and contemptible thing to live in ſuch Sobriety and Auſterity of Life; ſaying, That there were none but ſimple Philoſophers and melancholike Hermits, that lived after this manner. To let them ſee the contrary I have taken this pains: They may here behold how much
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:37302:215"/>
they are miſtaken, and how in all States, Qualities, and Conditions of Men, even from the greateſt to the meaneſt, Sobriety, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and Abſtinence, have been both honour'd, obſerv'd and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So that in concluſion I may truly ſay of all the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſts, of all the Sages of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Perſia;</hi> yea generally of all Prieſts that ſerved at the Alters of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and thoſe other Pagans Deities, that they did ſeldom eat Fleſh-meat, but never drank Wine; which truly may ſerve for a Subject of very ſerious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſome, that hold chief places in the Church of the True and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, who ought to be as Lamps ſhining in the midſt of the Temple; and by their Example, as well as Doctrine, to guide their Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the ways of True Piety and Vertue. Not that they have theſe Gentils only to look upon and follow as Preſidents; ſeeing the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Catholique Church doth (her ſelf)
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:37302:216"/>
by the Grace of God plentifully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford innumerable ſuch, in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Provinces, that is, Men of Holy and Exemplary Lives, who had the True Love and Fear of God in them in ſuch eminent manner, that their Converſation hath ſingularly edified the People under their charge, and excited them to all Godlineſs and Honeſty. So that (bleſſed be God) it is not ſo much for want of good Preſidents amongſt Chriſtians, that we mention Heathens and Gentiles in this Affair, but more effectually to convince ſome ſort of People of their ſhameful Practices; who will not be mov'd by, nor regard the example of good Chriſtians ſo well as they ought to do. To conclude, therefore I wiſh every one to take notice of a Saying of <hi>Socrates</hi> (that Wiſe and Worthy Gentile) who was wont to ſay, <hi>That the Soul which had gotten the habit and cuſtom of Sobriety and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her Eſtate, did paſs away her days in this World with as much</hi>

as the Holy Scripture makes mention, and aſſure us that it is (witneſs that of <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Qui abſtinens eſt, adjiciet Vitam. He that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinent, ſhall prolong his life:)</hi> it muſt likewiſe be acknowledged that the Exceſs of Drink muſt be cauſe of many Infirmities, and by them deſtroy the Body; which is alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred in the fore-going part of the Text above cited; <hi>Propter crapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam multi obierunt.</hi> By means of Drunkenneſs, many have come to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely ends. The Phyſician knowing that his Patient hath got a Surfeit, whether by Eating or Drinking, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently preſcribes him Abſtinence; and 'tis a Rule in Phyſick, That <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria contrariis curantur.</hi> Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are for the moſt part cur'd by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries. If the root or cauſe of the Sickneſs be too much Heat, it is cur'd by Cold, or rebating the Heat, if too much Moiſture, it is cur'd by Purging, diſſipating and evacuating the peccant Humour: which Saint
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:37302:217"/>
                           <hi>Hierome</hi> alſo confirms, ſaying, We read of many particular Diſeaſes and Infirmities, that proceed from the Exceſs of Drink; as Gouts, Dropſies, Feavers, and the like; which are cur'd and the Patients recover health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, meerly by being reduced to Abſtinence and ſlender Diet; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Superfluities and Exceſſes which at firſt cauſed the Diſtemper: the Drunkards Wine and Strong Drink (if I may ſo ſpeak) being in this reſpect like to the little Book, mentioned in the <hi>Apocalypſe (Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 11) which was commanded to be eaten; it is in the Mouth and going down, <hi>ſweet as Honey,</hi> but in their Stomach and Belly it is <hi>bitter,</hi> and hard of digeſtion.</p>
                        <p>So then, if you deſire to preſerve your ſelves in Health (I ſpeak here only of Bodily Health) you muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Counſel of <hi>Socrates,</hi> and be careful never to eat but when you are Hungry, nor ever to drink but when you are Dry and Thirſty;

becauſe to do otherwiſe, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no order, time, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in your Eating and Drinking, is the cauſe of many Infirmities, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, and Languiſhing of the Body, Pain in the Head, Pain in the Stomach, Diſtillations, Dropſies, and overflowing of groſs Humors all over the Body; ſuch an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diet tending rather to overcharge than to ſuſtain nature.

Now this wicked Sin of Drunkenneſs being in the rank of Deadly Sin, when it ſeizeth upon the Soul, muſt needs Stain, Poiſon, and Corrupt the ſame, depriving her of Grace, and the State of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.

ungrateful, and unacceptable, even all the good Works done by ſuch a Perſon, which otherwiſe might be meritorious of Eternal Life: So that in concluſion, the Soul being thus deveſted of all her Spiritual Ornaments and Graces, how can ſhe appear otherwiſe than wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and corrupted in the ſight of the Celeſtial Court. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> gives Drunkenneſs the Character of a <hi>bewitching Devil, a pleaſant Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for to take, and a pleaſant Sin to commit. But</hi> (ſays he) <hi>whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver holds the ſame, cannot hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and whoſoever is taken by it, may be ſaid not ſo much to Sin, as to be Sin it ſelf, becauſe his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on renders him ſubject to all Sin; and he is readily to be reduced to all manner of Wickedneſs. In concluſion</hi> (ſaith this Father) <hi>the Sin of Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs is worſe than that of Theft. Theeves commonly leave ſomething behind them, they do not always ſtrip, or leave naked thoſe whom they</hi>
                           <pb n="419" facs="tcp:37302:221"/>
                           <hi>Rob. But Drunkenneſs deprives of all Grace, takes away all whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of Spiritual Nature or Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſtrips us of all our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cloathing, and leaves the poor Soul as Naked, and void of all True Grace and Merit, as when it came firſt into the World. Theeves when they have got their Prey, uſually run away, or make all the haſte they can to be gone: But Drunkenneſs ſticks cloſe, holds faſt, and without all mercy proſecutes the poor deſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul to the laſt, even till her Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I add moreover, that if a Man be taken by Theeves, he may cry out, he may hope to be reſcued from them, or at leaſt if he ſees himſelf in danger of Life, he may call upon God and beg pardon of his Sins; he has time to diſpoſe himſelf for Death, by an Act of Contrition and True Repentance; by which means though he cannot ſave his Life, yet at leaſt he may ſave his Soul; which
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:37302:222"/>
Drunkenneſs will not permit to do being in that regard worſe than any Sin, but the Sin againſt the Holy a hoſt. For whotſoever kind of Sin</p>
                        <p>Man commits (be it of frailty, be it of preſumption, be it mortal, be it venial) and happens preſently upon it to find himſelf in eminen danger of Death, yet at leaſt by Gods Mercy he may have the Grace of Internal Repentance in Heart and Mind, and perhaps alſo the External Help of the Church; he may be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, he may may receive the moſt Holy Communion, he may have the laſt Sacrament Adminiſtred unto him. But if one falls into preſent danger of Death, while he is Drunk, he can do none of theſe. Drunkards while they are in their Drink, are Senſeleſs, neither able in the leaſt to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor capable to receive help from others; I mean Spiritual Help, and that which ſhould ſave their Souls, as well as their Bodies: but if they die, periſh in their Sin and

Certain it is, a moderate quantity of Drink, and alſo of Meat, hurteth not, but is neceſſary to ſatisfie and ſuſtain Nature; neither is it the uſe, but the abuſe of Meat and Drink (to wit, when we obſerve no meaſure) which cauſeth Diſeaſes: when the Golden Mean is obſerved, all goes well, but when it is neglected, great inconveniencies follow; according as <hi>Apuleius</hi> ſeems not unhandſomely to expreſs it.

The Traveller that wants Wiſdom, being Thirſty in the heat of Summer, as ſoon as he meets with a Ditch full of Water in his Journey, he preſently runs to it for to Drink, minding only to quench his Thirſt, and not at all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whether the Water be good, pure, clear, and wholeſom, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not corrupted, impure, and muddy; nor whether it be cold (as Water to Drink, ſhould be) or whether it be not heated with the Sun-beams, and made unfit to Drink. The unwiſe Traveller conſiders none of theſe things, nor what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences may follow, but ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Drink as much as he can, and ſo Drinks oft-times his own Death, or manifold Diſeaſes and Infirmities.

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:37302:225"/>
not to overcharge Nature, but to extinguiſh his Thirſt. In the ſame manner it is with many that dwell at home, and ſeldom travels farther than the Tavern, or Ale-Houſe that they haunt. They ruſh into theſe Common Drinking Places (far more corrupt and dangerous to the Soul, by reaſon of the many Tranſgreſſions committed in them, than any ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pool or muddy Water can be to the Body) and there fall to Tipple and Drink with as much Diſcretion, and Conſideration of what they do, as the Beaſt uſeth that goes from the Stall to Watering. Thus do many run daily to Drink, and by their enticements carry others along with them, and provoke them to Drink, not ſo much (many times) as well conſidering whether the Drink be good or bad.

Theſe two unfortunate Men came into a Tavern and called for Wine, which ſeeming to them to be weak, and little pleaſing to their Pallats, they inſiſted for better. So having taſted of all ſorts, they pitch'd at length upon that they found to be ſtrongeſt, and fell ſmartly to it; drinking to the Health of every one, they could think of, or call to mind upon that occaſion. Beginning to be
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:37302:226"/>
elevated; the one ſaid to the other, To whom ſhall we now Drink? The other replied, Drink to the Health of God, and you ſhall ſee how it ſhall be anſwered; but he being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and making difficulty at it, the wretch that made the motion, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſnatches the Glaſs out of his Companions hand, and in theſe words provoketh Divine Wrath upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſaying, O God hear me, I will Drink to thee in a full Glaſs, and if you do not pledge me, you do me injury. His Companion had firſt ask'd him of which Wine he would drink: Fill me of the New, replied the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for though it be raw and ſmall, yet I will drink it for this once. Then ſtretching his hand towards Heaven, he ſaid (as above!) To thee, O God I drink in a full Glaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and haven taken it clean off; he ſaid agian, O God, if you do not find this Wine good, blame not me; for if you had afforded us better Wine this year, I had drunk to you of the beſt. Having

ſpoke theſe words, he fell immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately down headlong upon the place, and ſo lay, not ſtirring Hand or Foot, void of all his Senſes and Reaſon; his Speech gone, and no motion to be perceiv'd in any part of him, ſave only in his Eyes, which mov'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.

They call for help, and ſend for the Magiſtrate, and Chief of the Town, who preſently came, and reſolved that he ſhould be tied with Ropes, and drawn away by force; this was alſo in vain. In concluſion, they all perceiv'd, that it was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Judgment of God inflicted upon him for his Sin, and to terrifie others.

                        <p>No marvel it ſhould be ſo: For firſt, men are naturally apt to boaſt and ſpeak highly and vauntingly of themſelves, oft-times much beyond the line of Truth and Modeſty, even when they are ſober: Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect leſs of them when they are drunk? and being, for the moſt part, ſuch kind of people as have little or nothing of good in them, who can wonder they ſhould glory in that which is ill? Let them alone, they boaſt but of their own; the vice, the ſin, the naughtineſs which is in their wicked hearts, overflows at their mouth; it muſt have a vent firſt or laſt, and a drunken fit is only a time when it comes forth with moſt eaſe. <hi>Where there is exceſs of Wine,</hi> ſaith S.

                        <p>Yea, ſuch is the unhappineſs of man, that partly through the force of Wine and ſtrong drink (which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers their brains, and perverts their minds ſo, that they conſider not what they do) and partly through that ſpirit of ſatanical emulation that is amongſt them, envying one another even in doing ill, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving who ſhall do worſt: it is a known thing, and frequently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this ſort of people, that in their Drink-revellings they will boaſt of much more wickedneſs than ever they committed indeed; only that they may not ſeem to be out-gone by others in this part of Devilliſh Gallantry, that is, in contemning God, and tranſgreſſing his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: Meerly that they may

                        <p>Neither is it any new thing.

                        <p>There is a double or twofold kind of filthineſs here to be taken notice of, The one, which is only <hi>ſordid,</hi> and offenſive to the eye of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: The other is <hi>ſinful,</hi> and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the eye of the Soul, when ſhe judges right, and (which is more) to the Eyes of God. They both at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend drunkenneſs, or the exceſs of meat and drink, when it is immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. The Drunkard ſhews himſelf a filthy Beaſt, in reſpect of this firſt kind of uncleanneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Body; witneſs their frequent vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſpewings, and caſtings out of that which they had intemperately taken in: For when their Stomachs, thoſe devouring Sepulchres, thoſe Bellies of <hi>Harpies,</hi> which raven all by gluttony and exceſſive drinking, have been in the day-time over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:37302:250"/>
with all ſorts of luſcious meat and ſtrong liquors, it ſeldom happens but in the night they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves by ſhameful vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and ſpewing.</p>
                        <p>Thus it was with the people of the <hi>Jews:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaias</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of it in theſe terms <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 28. 7.) <hi>Omnes prae Vino erraverunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All have erred through Wine</hi> (ſaith he) and <hi>through ſtrong drink all are out of the way.—All Tables are ſo filled of vomit and filthineſs, that there is no place clean.</hi> Is it not a deplorable thing to ſee Chriſtians at this day behave themſelves worſe than the bruit beaſts, they know when they have enough: the bruit beaſts neither eat nor drink till they vomit all up again: they eat and drink till Nature is ſatisfied; and when they have arrived to that point, all the art, and all the means you can uſe, ſhall not make them go further, till hunger and thirſt prompts them: Only Man, only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

and unwiſe man, eats and drinks to ſuch exceſs, as he is forced (to his ſhame, were he not paſt all ſhame) to caſt up his ſo unduly and indiſcreetly receiv'd ſuſtenance. Of all the Creatures that God hath made, Man only will drink to vomit, and vomit (O ſtrange! O devilliſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper!) to drink again; as to my knowledge is true.</p>

Beſides, if we call thoſe Naturals who want the uſe of reaſon (be it by birth, by ſickneſs, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accident) with how much more reaſon may we ſtile them ſo, that wilfully and of their own accord will loſe their Senſes, will deprive themſelves of the uſe of Reaſon, Underſtanding, Memory; that will voluntarily diſable their bodily limbs, and render them uſeleſs and unſerviceable; as namely, their hands, feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can we think ſuch worthy of the name of Reaſonable Men? yet all this do the Drunkards.

Example and Pattern to imitate, who of his infinite goodneſs was pleaſed to take Humane Nature upon him, for the Salvation of all Mankind; and to make ſatisfaction for our Sins, and particularly for our Sins of Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenneſs; by which moſt commonly all other Sins find Admittanre amongſt Chriſtians; and for which he ſatisfied by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Hunger and Thirſt, and by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Sobriety and Abſtinence all his Life long, at his Birth and in his Death. In his Birth his Abſtinence was ſuch, that he appear'd deſtitute even of all manner of neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, being rejected from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all Humane Creatures, and reduced to the neceſſity of being Born in a Stable, among Bruit Beaſts.

Our Saviour knew their Hearts, and the wicked ſiniſter intentions which they had in every thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt that they did; and therefore
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:37302:283"/>
might juſtly by himſelf, or by the Evangeliſt, condemn them for what he knew them to be: But to us the inward ſecrets of the Heart are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and unknown; and therefore where we ſee outward appearances, and ſhews of good, though they be in reality no better than thoſe of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Hypocritical and ſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we ought to judge the beſt, and not haſtily to cenſure or condemn them for Hypocrites, or to ſuſpect them for unchaſte perſons, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Adulterers, or Sinners, in any other kind.

                        <p>To reaſſume therefore our chief pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I ſay, that if Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; according to the Evangeliſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends ſo ſeverely, and even cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe that only entertain and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter

Carnal Concupiſcence in their hearts, though they proceed not to the outward acts of that foul ſin, how much are they to be reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reprov'd, and what Curſes are due to them, that give themſelves up to the acts of filthy Luſt; abounding in all kinds of Carnal Senſuality, and committing uncleanneſs even with greedineſs, as the Scripture ſpeaks of them; being wholly defiled in their thoughts, in their words, and in their deeds; that are become impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſin, taking pride, and even glorying in that which is moſt vile.

                        <p>Wherefore to avoid the curſes and maledictions pronounced againſt this Sin, follow the counſel of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (1 Cor. 6. v. 18.) <hi>Fly Fornication,</hi> abominate the practice of all carnal

                        <p>THere be many good reaſons to be given, why the ſin of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiſcence is ſo ſtrictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God; yet we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, according to St. <hi>Bonaventure,</hi>
                           <pb n="532" facs="tcp:37302:288"/>
that the chief reaſon is, becauſe it is ſo advantagious to Satan, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys more Souls by it than by any other ſin. This ſin brings him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways double gain, whereas other ſins brings him only ſingle gain. By the wicked Act of unlawful Copula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he gets two Souls at leaſt, if not more: by other ſins, unleſs by chance, and <hi>per accidens,</hi> he gets but one Soul at a time. Fornication, Adultery, Inceſt, and the like ſins of Carnality; are ſeldom committed, but beſides the two principals, there are other perſons acceſſary thereto, as commonly ſome Old Bawd, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with Age and ill Practices, and others, that by connivence, conſent, procurement, aſſiſtance, or occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, do lend their help, and ſerve inſtead of Bawds, to the lewd buſineſs. In other ſins there is no ſuch need of help; they may be (all) committed ſolitarily (as I may ſay) or by one ſingle perſon alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For this cauſe (I ſay) it is the
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:37302:288"/>
opinion of ſome, that the immortal enemy of Souls, takes more pains, and is more induſtrious and vigilant to induce and tempt mankind to ſins of Carnal Concupiſcence, than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others: and to this agrees the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Saint <hi>Iſidore;</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <q>Humane kind to be more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and made more ſlave to Satan, by means of Carnality and Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality than by any other Vices what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</q>

of God, but of Satan; and we know who hath ſaid (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 15.) <hi>What Concord</hi> (or Cohabitation) <hi>is there betwixt Chriſt (who is God, Bleſſed for ever)</hi> and <hi>Belial?</hi> who is the proper Spirit, or Devil of Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſhoneſty? Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it is, that like a <hi>Roaring Lyon,</hi> this wicked Spirit runneth about night and day, never ceaſing to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault mankind with temptations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his lewd and devilliſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition; to wit, by preſenting car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or unchaſte objects (whether of perſons or actions) to his eyes; wanton diſcourſe, or filthy ſpeech, to his ears; laſcivious thoughts to his mind: after this manner he is continually hunting for his Prey, and ſeeking to devour unhappy Souls; it is his whole imployment, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand arts and wiles to draw mankind into the ſnare, and inſlave him to this filthy Vice. He is an adverſary, that wakes and watches perpetually to do us miſchief; he ſleeps not, being
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:37302:289"/>
inceſſantly attent to his imployment, which is firſt to deceive, and then to deſtroy us. So that we may rightly ſay of him, what the Holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of his Afflicters <hi>(Job</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 17.) <hi>Qui me comedunt, non dormiunt: They that conſume me, do not ſleep. They conſume,</hi> they make me weary of my Life, by the conſtant purſuit of their temptations, and <hi>ſleep not;</hi> that is, they give not over their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting ſo much as for a moment.</p>
                        <p>The Chariot of Concupiſcence, like that of <hi>Jehu</hi> (4 <hi>Reg.</hi> 9. 20.) <hi>marcheth furiouſly,</hi> as it needs muſt, <hi>Belial</hi> himſelf, the Prince of Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, driving it; it goeth through all Countries and Kingdoms, never ſtopping, or ſtaying long in any place: It is in the Court, it is in the Country, it is in Cities, it is in Towns, it is in every poor Village; all in a moment, and being made of Hell-Fire, it caſts abroad Sparkles, of Concupiſcence and unclean De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; on all ſides a bit goes, which
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:37302:290"/>
inflame luſtful hearts, and ſet them on fire to work wickedneſs. Thus go Drabbers (commonly) by Troops to Hell; the Devil drves them like ſo many Herd of Swine (as they are, and more filthy) into the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lake, where they periſh for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; whereas other ſinner go either ſingle, or in ſmall companies thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Again, (generally ſpeaking) all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins are proper to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, or States of Life: As Pride (for example) ſeems moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for People in high place, and for great ones: it being a ſtrange <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decorum,</hi> that people of low and mean rank ſhould be proud. Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſhould not be found any where but amongſt profeſſed Uſurers, and ſuch as make Gold their God; and the like is to be ſaid of other ſins; only this ſin (this vile ſin of Leche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Carnal Concupiſcence) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all: All ſorts of People, High and low, Rich and Poor, Young
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:37302:290"/>
and Old, Church-man and Lay-man (all of them more or leſs) have a ſmack of it, and are too generally tainted with it.</p>
                        <p>There goes a ſtory, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil had a Wife, of whom he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Seven Daughters, very much reſembling their Father: all which, when they were grown up, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon ſeveral ſorts of People. His Eldeſt Daughter was called <hi>Pride</hi> (Madam <hi>Pride)</hi> whom he beſtowed upon Women; not doubting, but ſhe would be well received by that Sex; whoſe minds he knew, were ſo given to Vanity, Coſtlineſs of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and tricking up themſelves (no ſmall Symptomes of Pride) that they ſeem to ſpend the greateſt part of their time (except when they are in Bed, or at the Table) in conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Looking-glaſſes, combing, and plating their falſe Hair, or ſome other way trimming, and making themſelves fine.

her he beſtowed upon Citizens, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers of Great Towns, and ſome Rich Chubs in the Country, that look't after her. His Third, call'd <hi>Felony,</hi> and <hi>Robbery,</hi> he beſtowed upon Highway-men, caſheer'd Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and Cadets; Men commonly of high Spirits, but low Fortune. His fourth Daughter, call'd <hi>Simony,</hi> he commended to certain Church-men, whom he knew much more willing to hold the place, than to diſcharge the Office of a Biſhop, Cure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The fifth, called <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> he beſtowed upon Bigots, and Profeſſors; a ſort of People (ſucceſſors to the Old Phariſies) in outward behaviour and Shew, very Demure, and Seeming-Good; but inwardly in Heart and private Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, far otherwiſe.

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:37302:296"/>
Thoughts (coming to mind, either by natural occaſion, or by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation and ſuggeſtion of Satan:) an infirmity, to which depraved Nature is too much ſubject, and inſinuated by the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James,</hi> in that paſſage of his <hi>(Jac.</hi> 1. 31.) where he ſaith, <hi>Nemo cum tentatur, dicat, &amp;c. Let no man, when he is tempted, ſay that he is tempted of God; for God is not a tempter of evils, and tempteth no man. But every one is tempted of his own Concupiſcence, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with carried away and inticed.</hi> Which <hi>Concupiſcence, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth ſin; and ſin, when it is conſummated, genders death.</hi> Concupiſcence, does then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to carry us away from God, when we ſuffer our mind to wander about ſuch matters, though without any intention to ſin: which the Prophet ſeems to expreſs a little more plainly <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 1. 16.) where he ſaith, <hi>Waſh you, and be clean; Auferte malum cogitationum veſtrarum, &amp;c. Take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

                           <hi>the evil of your thoughts from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes;</hi> to wit, thoſe evil Thoughts, with which you ſuffer your minds to be ſo taken up, that you can find no time, to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what I command you. Caſt ſuch Thoughts out of your mind, as ſoon as you can perceive them; take no delight, nor pleaſure in them; for though, perhaps, they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſinful, yet they are alwayes dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and will quickly lead you to ſin, if you reſt in them.</p>
                        <p>I accknowledg it to be moſt true, that though the Evil Spirit plies us, and purſues us never ſo much with his ſuggeſtions, and putting laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts into our mind, they can do us no harm, ſo long as we reſiſt them, or give no conſent to them; but are rather matter of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to us: for ſo often as we do ſo, we do foil Satan in his aſſault, we repulſe our Ghoſtly Enemy, and get a Victory over him, for which we may expect a Crown one day, if we perſever to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:37302:297"/>
the end. But if we let his Suggeſtions (evil Thoughts) to reſt in us, and our mind to be taken up with them after relexion, eſpecially if it be with any ſport or pleaſure taken, we do not fight with our Ghoſtly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but play with him: and that's dangerous. Temptation verily is no ſin; yet it ſerveth as the ſeed of ſin; to which Delectation giving nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſin at length comes forth by willing conſent: and then we are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt, till repentance reſtores us.</p>
                        <p>But, having the grace to be free from complacency or delight-taking in evil thoughts, and the care (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious and diligent care) to caſt them out of your mind, ſo ſoon as you percieve them, or reflect upon what you are thinking, fear not, you are pure, you are innocent, you are clean, how impure, foul, and nocent ſoever your thoughts be. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent not to them, and the badder they are, the better it ſhall be for

you: for the greater the Temptation is, that you overcome, the greater ſhall be your Victory and Crown.</p>
                        <p>Sudden, and voluntary motions, to whatſoever they incline, are no ſin, according to that of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>Nunc autem jam non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go operor illud, &amp;c. It is not I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me:</hi> By which expreſſions (as the Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons obſerve) the Apoſtle means, That though the Fleſh, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour parts do ſtir up diſorderly paſſions, motions, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the mind, on the ſudden, and invade the ſame before we are well aware of it, or that reaſon can gather up it ſelf to put them by (by reaſon whereof man is for a while entangled with them againſt his will) yet ſo long as upon reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he does perceive them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, does make what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he can againſt them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and caſting them out of his mind, and deverting himſelf to
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:37302:298"/>
better Thoughts, there is no fear, nor ſcruple to be had of ſin: many juſt and holy perſons ſuffering the like perturbations in the inferiour, or ſenſitive part of their mind (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called the Phantaſie) and alſo in their exteriour members; to which their Underſtanding and Will never conſents: which ſo long as we do not, it is moſt true what Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> That we need not ſay, <hi>God forgive us our ſins,</hi> for any contingencies of this nature: and it ought to be a moſt certain and aſſured ſign to us, that we if do not conſent to ſuch things, but meerly and paſſively ſuffer them againſt our wills, if we find our ſelves to take no pleaſure, or delight in the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or remembrance of them (but are rather griev'd and aſhamed for ſuch our frailties) and that ſo ſoon as we do take notice of them, we be ſeriouſly diligent to put them out of our minds, and to divert our Thoughts to God, or ſome other
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:37302:299"/>
good matter. If our conſcience upon interrogation tells us, that it is thus with us, it were ſin to have any ſcruple, or apprehenſion of ſin for ſuch matter. But where it is otherwiſe, that is, when our conſcience doth not thus anſwer us, but that we find our ſelves negligent in putting ſuch Thoughts out of our mind, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as we do perceive them, or that we take complacency, and delight in the ſenſe and feeling of ſuch Thoughts preſent, or remembrance of them paſt, then indeed 'tis beſt to fear the worſt, and to deem our ſelves guilty of ſin, more or leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of ſuch evil Thoughts, or Phantaſms, and the meaſure of the Complacency taken in them. For ſo ſoon as we yield, or give way to Senſual complacency in luſtful Thoughts, or Imaginations, we fall into the Boggs and Quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires of Sin preſenly.</p>
                        <p>Now of all that hath been above ſaid, we have an example in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:37302:299"/>
of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who, by his own acknowledgment ſeems to have been much exerciſed in ſuch conflicts as theſe <hi>(viz.</hi> between the Fleſh and the Spirit) and troubled with the ſuggeſtions of the Ghoſtly Enemy. For ſo he ſaith of himſelf, Rom. 7. v. 22. <hi>Condelector enim legi Dei ſecundum interiorem hominem, &amp;c. I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted</hi> (I conſent and conform my ſelf) <hi>to the Law of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inner man</hi> (that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit of my mind, underſtanding, reaſon and will) <hi>but I ſee another Law</hi> (that is another, and contrary inclination) <hi>in my members</hi> (to wit, in the members of my Body, and the inferiour parts or powers of my Soul, which ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize with them) <hi>repugnant to the law of my mind, and captivating</hi> (that is, rendring me in ſome ſort ſubject) <hi>to the Law</hi> (that is, to the motions and inclinations) <hi>of ſin.</hi> Whence it is evident, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, though he ſelt motions, and
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:37302:300"/>
inclinations to ſin in his outward, and inferiour parts, yet as to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſuperiour, he kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free, and diſſented from them.</p>
                        <p>Let us then, to the beſt of our power imitate the ſteps, and follow this Valiant Champion in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Warfare. Let us not fear, nor be troubled at the Suggeſtions of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but reſiſt them firſt, and then deſpiſe them; knowing, that the beſt, and moſt perfect men, that ever were in the world, have been frequently aſſaulted, and much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with the like. The Son of the Living God (our Saviour himſelf) was not altogether free from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as the Goſpel ſhews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 3. It is nothing to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but it is all, to be led into Temptation, ſo as to fall by it. It is not in our power to be free from the motions of Concupiſcence; but it is in our power, through the grace of God, to reſiſt them, and give no conſent to ſuch motions: and ſo
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:37302:300"/>
long as we do not, let Concupiſcence trouble us never ſo much, yet we truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Ego non operor, I do nothing, I do not work, or do</hi> any thing, by a <hi>free, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, humane act,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nothing, that ſhall be imputed to me for ſin. Concupiſcence indeed works ſome natural effect or moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in me: But Concupiſcence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without my voluntary yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, can never work ſin, and that's my comfort: for which I bleſs God.</p>

                        <p>It is clear then, that by toleration of Senſual Complacency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light taken in the impure Thoughts and Imaginations of Sin, as by Two Steps, the Sin of Carnal Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence proceeds, or comes forth, out of the heart and inward inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the outward and perfect act. It remains that we conſider next, whether the willful, or voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the mind to perpetrate the outward act, opportunity being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, be not a Third Step. Truly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>objections can be alledg'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. All Divines, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any; are of that opinion; and affirm the ſame, as a thing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently warranted and grounded in Holy Scripture. For firſt, acording to
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:37302:304"/>
the holy Evangeliſt Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 19. We read; that from <hi>the heart come forth evil cogitations, Murder; Adulteries, Fornications, and the like: which things defile a man.</hi> It ſeems as much as to ſay, that whenſoever Voluntary conſent is given; to commit; either Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery, Fornication, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other forbidden Act of Carnal Luſt, then is the Sin of Murder, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Fornication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then is the Soul defiled with ſuch ſin, or ſins reſpectively.</p>
                        <p>As for example, if one gives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in mind and heart to deflowre a Virgin, or defile his Neighbours Wife, though for want of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or for ſome other occaſion, the outward act of ſuch ſin, or ſins, is not perpetrated, or done, yet is the party that ſo conſents, culpable and guilty before God, as if it had been done; becauſe the holy Scripture doth not only forbid the outward act, but alſo the will, purpoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:37302:305"/>
or deſire to do it. It is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> in the outward act, but <hi>thou ſhalt not</hi> ſo much <hi>as covet thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife, by</hi> any deſire, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy heart, to defile her. And therefore our Saviour in the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaith (chap. 5. v. 28.) <hi>Audiſtis, quia dictum eſt antiquis, &amp;c. You have heard, it has been ſaid of old, Thou ſhalt not commit Aduletery. But I ſay unto you, that whoſoever ſhall look upon a Woman, to luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her</hi> (though but in his heart, or internal conſent) <hi>he hath already committed Adultery with her,</hi> by reaſon of the ſaid internal conſent. So that this paſſage of the Evangeliſt is not only a full Declaration of our Saviours mind touching this matter, but alſo a fair warning given to all, to be careful to avoid, not only the outward, corporal actions of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, and the like, but alſo the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or the foſtering of any will,
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:37302:305"/>
purpoſe, or deſire to commit the ſame, if we had opportunity.</p>
                        <p>Moſt certain therefore it is, and not at all to be doubted of, if a man willingly gives away, or conſents in his mind to any ſuch luſtful Action, he is in the ſame inſtant that he gives ſuch conſent, overthrown, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fallen from the ſtate of Grace, all good Thoughts, or Purpoſes, of what kind ſoever, vanquiſh and die, as to any acceptance with God; all former merits is loſt, and the ſinner made a ſubject and ſlave of Satan, no leſs really, than if he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſin it ſelf in outward deed: and ſo he continues, till true and hearty repentance reſtores him to better ſtate. And as in all ſins gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, ſo eſpecially in theſe of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Concupiſcence and Luſt, we may obſerve this method of Satan, <hi>viz.</hi> that firſt he <hi>ſuggeſts</hi> the ſin to mind upon the ſight, remembrance, company, or converſation of ſome perſon, or otherwiſe, upon <hi>the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion</hi>

                        <p>AH Parents! How am I troubled for you, that you take ſo much Pains, and labour ſo hard to leave great Eſtates to your Children: you
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:37302:318"/>
never ceaſe <hi>joyning Houſe to Houſe, and Land to Land, till there be no place;</hi> you never ceaſe Building and Planting, Buying and Purchaſing great Eſtates, great Rents; you Heap up, and Hoard up Gold and Silver without end, never knowing when you have Wealth enough: whereas many times it falls out, that you leave all to a Prodigal Son, who in a few years time will ſcatter that, which you have been covetouſly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together all your Life long. Do you not ſee, how you damn your own Souls, to leave matter of Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury to your Children? never ſo much as remembring or thinking upon that great charge, which the Apoſtle gives to Rich Men (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 18.) namely, <hi>That they ſet not their minds too much, nor truſt in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Riches,</hi> but that they <hi>do good</hi> with their Wealth, and be <hi>rich in good works,</hi> in Almes-deeds, in Charity and Liberality towards the Poor. Theſe Things ought you to
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:37302:319"/>
think upon, Rich Men, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your ſelves to be ſo blinded with Natural Affection towards your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after the Fleſh, as to think of nothing but Enriching them, and leaving them great Eſtates to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume in Luxury. A juſt Judgment and Curſe of God upon you, for your extream Hard-heartedneſs, and great unmindfulneſs of thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God <hi>(the poor of his people)</hi> whom their Heavenly Father hath left, and ſo ſpecially recommended to your Care and Compaſſion. O wretched Luxury! How many, how great Eſtates haſt thou waſted, and brought the Heirs and Owners of them to great Poverty in this World, and to eternal miſeries in the next!</p>
                        <p>Looking into Scripture, I find there even <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelf in the Rank and Number of theſe <hi>Spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrifts.</hi> He, though he were not only an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> by Nation and Birth, but alſo a <hi>Nazarite from the Womb</hi> (as he is peculiarly ſtiled by

God himſelf, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 5. 7.) that is, a Perſon dedicated to Gods ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Service, even from the firſt day of his Nativity; yet he muſt have his <hi>Dalila,</hi> his Female Aſſociate, to ſerve his Luſt; with whom fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Love, and Living, he ſoon brought himſelf to Ruin, being by her betrayed into his Enemies hands; who forced him, having firſt <hi>put out his Eyes,</hi> to undergo hard Labour, even to <hi>Grind</hi> (by a Hand-mill) <hi>in the Priſon Houſe, all the days of his Life;</hi> as you may read more at large in the Book of <hi>Judges, Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>Sichem</hi> (of whom we read, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 34.) was ſuch another. He, though a Prince by Deſcent, and much beloved of his People, yet for being taken with Carnal Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence towards <hi>Dinah,</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and defiling her, he loſt both his Kingdom and Life. What ſhall I ſay of the Prodigal Son, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpel <hi>(Chap.</hi> 15. 12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> who by Living
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:37302:320"/>
Riotouſly with Whores and Lewd Women, waſted his Portion in a ſhort time, and was reduc'd thereby to extream miſery.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Examples of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I ſhall add one out of Humane Story. <hi>Bromiardus, reports of a Man, who having conſum'd and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted all that he had upon a Whore, came at length to be rejected and ſcorned by her. He had ſpent a good Estate upon her, and now ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reduced to abſolute Beggary, and that (his Wealth being gone) the Strumpet ſcorn'd him, struck with ſhame, he leaves the City: which the Lewd Woman (his Paramour) hearing of, ſhe follows him with Cries. The Old Bawd, that waited upon her, thinking it had been out of ſome Paſſion ſhe had for him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts her, and bids her be content. Let him go</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and ere it be long, I'll pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure you one Richer than he.</hi> The wicked Harlot hearing this, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:37302:320"/>
replies<hi>: You much miſtake me; I cry not for him: I am only vext that he carries away a good Shirt on his Back, which I meant to have had before his departure.</hi> Behold here a full Verification of what was long before Propheſied by the Wiſe King, <hi>Solomon; Prov.</hi> 29. 3. <hi>Qui nutrit ſcorta, perdit ſubſtantiram. He that maintains Harlots ſhall waſte his own ſubſtance.</hi> Beware therefore, take heed of it: of all Prodigal and Wicked Expences be ſure you ſhun that (which is the worſt of all) for fear, leaſt it deſtroy you Body and Soul; and leaſt you find your ſelves (you that ſwim in Luxury and Wealth at preſent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you be aware of it, reduced to a Morſel of Bread. Do not think that the Scripture gives you ſo many Warnings for nothing.</p>
                        <p>The ſin of Carnal Concupiſcence is for this reaſon, not unrightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by ſome to the Horſe-leach, which being applied to Mans Body,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:37302:321"/>
ſticks faſt to it, ſucking the Blood, and not ceaſing, ſo long as ſhe is able to hold. In the ſame manner the Vice of Concupiſcence, ſeizing upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, draines him off his Wealth, lies continually ſucking and drawing from him, till nothing be left but a Diſeaſed and Foul Carkaſs, which for a time he muſt carry about him; till at length, through Rottenneſs and Corruption, that alſo falls and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Meat for Worms. It is a Plague that infects and deſtroys all, even Vertuous Perſons ſometimes, if they take not heed: according to that Saying of the Wiſe Man, <hi>Eccluſ.</hi> 19. 2. <hi>Wine and Women, apoſtatare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt ſapientes, &amp;c. make even Wiſe Men to fall away, and he that joyns himſelf to Harlots, will be naught. Rottenneſs and Worms ſhall have him to Herritage. He ſhall be ſet for an Example</hi> of Dread and Terror; and his <hi>Soul ſhall not be reckoned in the number of the living.</hi>

God in wrath delivers impenitent, obſtinate Sinners up to them; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as by the teſtimony of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he did <hi>the Gentiles:</hi> of whom it is written <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26, 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that God (for their ſins of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Idolatry and Uncleanneſs, Corporal and Spiritual) <hi>gave them up to a Spirit of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, to Vile Affections, to a reprobate mind,</hi> (void of all ſound Judgment) and to <hi>do things that were not convenient:</hi> and all to teach us, what the horrid effects of unbridled luſt are upon the minds of Men, deſtitute of the Grace of God, and given up to the power of Satan.</p>
                        <p>The Luxurious Man is ſo ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that for the proſecution and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his Luſt, he puts all other Concerns in Oblivion, and does things without any conſideration or reaſon. He gives his poor Soul to the Devil and Eternal Damnation for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Can any thing be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable? He loſes the Kingdom

no wiſe man, that is Maſter of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, values; neither ſhould any well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtructed Chriſtian admit, or think of, but in order to ſome higher and more vertuous ends; <hi>viz.</hi> the lawful procreation of Children, to be brought up in the Knowledge and Fear of God, and for the Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Conjugal Fidelity and Amity.</p>
                        <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is of the ſame mind with me, and confirms what I have ſaid by his own Teſtimony, ſaying, <hi>That whoever, for a little, ſhort, pleaſure of this world</hi> (he means the pleaſure of a Voluptuous Carnal Act) <hi>gives away that for which Chriſt gave himſelf to death:</hi> (to wit his Soul) <hi>there can be no doubt made, but in doing ſo he forfeits his reaſon quite, and at the ſame inſtant ſhews himſelf to be an unreaſonable, ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs bruitiſh perſon, ſcarce deſerving the name of man.</hi> Which conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, another moſt learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine compares a laſci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
